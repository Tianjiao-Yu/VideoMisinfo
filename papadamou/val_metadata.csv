q_5n7URd2Gk,2017-09-22,The Bermuda Triangle Mystery Has Been Solved,"Scientists May Have Finally Cracked the Greatest Mystery Behind the Bermuda Triangle. 

How many creepy stories about the disappearing of airplanes and ships in the Bermuda Triangle have you heard? We guess many. 

It is a large area in the Atlantic Ocean between Florida, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. This region is notorious for its mysterious phenomena. Huge amounts of ships and planes have disappeared here. Its second name is ‘The devil’s triangle.'  
All those mythical vanishings happened under unknown and unexplained circumstances. Some of the planes and ships have never been found. There have been many theories about why it all occurs in that area starting from waterspouts to aliens and even sea monsters. But those were only theories...

TIMESTAMPS
Where is the Bermuda Triangle? 0:22
Theories 0:47
A big incident in 2005 1:40
Stories behind the Bermuda triangle 2:50
The main mystery solved 3:08

SUMMARY
- In 1945 five American torpedo bombers and a plane that was sent out to find them vanished without a trace.
- 75 aircraft and several hundred ships have been lost. 
- The latest tragedy happened in 2015 when the cargo ship ""El Faro"" disappeared in this region.
- In 2005 the first Piper-PA airplane disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle.
- In 2007 one more Piper-PA airplane disappeared near Berry Island.

Many stories are whirling around this area. But now, finally, the mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle, might have been solved.

JtFt-B6i80w,2015-02-05,You Won't Believe Where Anti-Vaxxers Get Their Information,"""As the vaccination wars continue to escalate, a new study suggests that trusted doctors and experts may be no match for the loud and often inaccurate wisdom of Internet commenters.

In a first-of-its kind experiment, researchers at Washington State University have shown that people tend to be persuaded less by credible pro- and anti-vaccination information published online than by individual users who hang around in comments threads on the topic kicking up dust.

The findings, which will appear in an upcoming Journal of Advertising, underscore the powerful influence of information disseminated by word of mouth. Moreover, they offer a striking insight into the ability of the anti-vaccination movement to flourish despite mounting outrage and overwhelming scientific evidence that supports vaccination.""

But Are These Studies Helping?","You may have heard of a recent study published in JAMA that once again confirmed that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not related to autism. I just met the author of the study at a recent meeting, and she told me that the study is evidently the number one most downloaded from JAMA. Ever.
The study's findings, widely covered in the media, are considered robust and important. But it may be time to question how much good continued research in this area is doing. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

The media is doing a poor job informing the public with accurate information on COVID-19. They bring on self-proclaimed experts that make claims that have no ground in science and sometimes are full-on lying. Also, I think they are leaning into the fear angle too hard in order to draw clicks and viewership. I believe they should uphold proper journalistic standards and stick to the facts!

WfEqAolZFB0,2019-05-08,We Asked People If They Care About Homo Sapien Extinction,"The U.N. released a big report this week that says among other things, that more than a million species of plants and animals are facing extinction. This is something we need to act on, so to raise awareness, we went out on the street to ask people if they were worried about one endangered species in particular - 'Homo Sapiens.' Homo Sapiens, of course, are humans. So we asked humans if they care about the extinction of humans, and this is what we got back.

soI0q3CBliE,2019-12-21,6 year old little Irish girl hilariously insists on going to the pub 😂😂,"My 6 year old daughter Katie insisting that she should get to go to the pub. She is hilarious, watch until the end 😂😂

The background to this video is that there was a Christmas party that night in our local pub for the local women's soccer team. Katie's dad is the coach and two of her aunties play on the team. Katie comes to all the matches and training sessions and is basically the team mascot!. When she heard they were having a Christmas party she just couldn't understand why she wasn't invited😂😂. She had been begging her dad all day to bring her and after a few hours he gave up explaining that it was on too late, (kids are welcome in pubs with parents until 9/9.30pm), hence why she came to try and plead her case with me 😂😂. Katie is smart, funny, kind, courageous, caring, wise beyond her years, mannerful and full of life and I'm so proud that she has brought some laughter to so many people ❤️

LYRICS: 

(verse)

It's gettin' lonely way out here
Yeah, space'll do that to you, but let me be clear
I'm one heartbroken satellite

You see, it's been a while since I've seen you around
40 years since you last touched my lunar ground
So a call, at least, would be nice

(chorus)
You moved on to better things
Said it was the money, but maybe it's me
And you changed everything with one giant leap
And then you left me, oh, maybe
It's a conspiracy

I don't know this Houston guy
But I'll bet he can't shine as bright as I
Oh, there's so much of me you've yet to learn

And worst of all, you left your little prints on me
Stuck a pretty thorn in my side, oh, is that all you need?
You've been gone so long, but the memory still hurts

(chorus)

Oh, what can I do?
Until you return, I'll watch the asteroids burn
I just don't glow like I used to
And as I count the days, I'm drifting further and further and further and further and further and further away

(chorus)",Kerrin Connolly,UCebha6ne1Gxr7cdD_jtRzpA,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCebha6ne1Gxr7cdD_jtRzpA,29617.0,120.0,1069.0,247.0,[],"['conspiracy', 'the moon', 'moon landing', '1969', ""it's a conspiracy"", 'ukulele', 'baritone ukulele', 'tiny desk contest', 'tiny desk concert', 'npr', '2018', 'entry', 'original', 'singer songwriter', 'boston', 'massachusetts', 'music', 'acoustic', 'surf rock', 'the 60s music', 'surfer', 'funny', 'jonathan coulton', 'molly lewis', 'joco', 'kerrin connolly', 'kerrin']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPDPBSXQvpo/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-vaccination,science,

zyZ7u8GRF70,2019-03-05,Why are there still anti-vaxxers? | Al Jazeera English,"A study of more than half a million children in Denmark shows there is no link between autism and the MMR vaccine, which is used to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. Yet people continue to resist vaccinations.

Tens of thousands of people die every year from measles, a disease that can be prevented with a simple vaccine.  

Al Jazeera's Mereana Hond looks at why, against all scientific proof, scepticism over vaccines persists.

HaraFkhonFo,2020-05-05,Why we're seeing mass layoffs in the US but not the UK,"Tens of millions of Americans are out of work because of the coronavirus. But it didn't have to be that way -- and it's not too late for the US to change course.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Few Americans alive today have ever seen unemployment numbers as bad as they are right now. At the end of April 2020, economists estimated that between 13 and 18 percent of US workers were unemployed. It's the highest rate since the Great Depression. 

That figure can seem somewhat inevitable; the unfortunate but unavoidable cost of economic lockdown. It’s why, in response, Congress has prioritized shoring up unemployment insurance benefits.

But a handful of European countries have shown that mass unemployment isn’t a given in a situation like this. It’s a policy choice. 

In this video, we explain how and why the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands chose a different path. With the help of economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, we explore whether the US can still avoid millions more job losses.

r6ewlQs8CAQ,2020-05-23,The US tested the wrong people for coronavirus,"And you can tell because of a number called the test positivity rate.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

As the rate of new coronavirus cases in the US slows down, many states and cities there are encouraging businesses to open again, easing the lockdowns that have been in place since March. But public health experts warn that in many of those places, opening up is premature.

The reason is that throughout the US, as well as in many other countries, we still don’t really know how many people have the virus, or where they are. That’s dangerous because it means infected people who don’t feel sick are probably mingling with the rest of the population, which could enable further outbreaks. And the only way to really prevent that is by proactively testing people for covid-19 until the people who have it have been tracked down and isolated.

The US started testing its population for covid-19 very slowly, but it’s since ramped testing up, and by early May was performing over 200,000 tests a day. Unfortunately, there’s no magic number of tests that is “enough” to contain an outbreak. The important thing is to test the right people — and to evaluate whether that’s happening, public health officials recommend looking at a different number: The percentage of tests coming back positive. It’s called the test positivity rate.

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.
Previous headline: What the US needs to do to open up safely

In a previous version of this video, the circles in the infographic at 5:50 and 6:20 were incorrectly sized. The error has been corrected.

Today’s phones are hard to put down. Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Tristan Harris, who runs Time Well Spent, is working to create a world where platforms can more honestly respect their users’ time.

It's suspected an unvaccinated French child has reintroduced measles to Costa Rica, after the country had been free of the disease for five years.

4vuv6uKs0XU,2020-07-20,Trump falsely touts US Covid-19 death rate,"During a meandering and occasionally hostile interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump made a very bold claim: that the United States has the lowest mortality rate from Covid-19 anywhere in the world.
""I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest, mortality rate anywhere in the world,"" Trump told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace. ""Do you have the numbers please? I heard we had the best mortality rate,"" he added to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who was off-camera.
When McEnany returned with a piece of paper, Trump turned on Wallace. ""Number one low mortality rate,"" he said, attacking Wallace for reporting ""fake news"" in the process. ""You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world, and we have the best.""
But the President's claim is not true. And it's not even close.
The US in fact has one of the highest death rates from the coronavirus of any country, and is worse than several badly-hit countries like Brazil, Mexico and Russia, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

Peel off your tin-foil hat like a Hershey’s Kiss, because Bill Nye has a reality check for the alien conspiracists out there. Roswell? Area 51? Vincent D'Onofrio as the roach alien in MIB? Bill Nye shoos them away, deeming each as unrealistic as the next.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILL NYE:
Bill Nye, scientist, engineer, comedian, author, and inventor, is a man with a mission: to help foster a scientifically literate society, to help people everywhere understand and appreciate the science that makes our world work. Making science entertaining and accessible is something Bill has been doing most of his life.
 In Seattle Nye began to combine his love of science with his flair for comedy, when he won the Steve Martin look-alike contest and developed dual careers as an engineer by day and a stand-up comic by night. Nye then quit his day engineering day job and made the transition to a night job as a comedy writer and performer on Seattle’s home-grown ensemble comedy show “Almost Live.” This is where “Bill Nye the Science Guy®” was born. The show appeared before Saturday Night Live and later on Comedy Central, originating at KING-TV, Seattle’s NBC affiliate. 
 While working on the Science Guy show, Nye won seven national Emmy Awards for writing, performing, and producing. The show won 18 Emmys in five years. In between creating the shows, he wrote five children’s books about science, including his latest title, “Bill Nye’s Great Big Book of Tiny Germs.”
 Nye is the host of three currently-running television series. “The 100 Greatest Discoveries” airs on the Science Channel. “The Eyes of Nye” airs on PBS stations across the country.
 Bill’s latest project is hosting a show on Planet Green called “Stuff Happens.” It’s about environmentally responsible choices that consumers can make as they go about their day and their shopping. Also, you’ll see Nye in his good-natured rivalry with his neighbor Ed Begley. They compete to see who can save the most energy and produce the smallest carbon footprint. Nye has 4,000 watts of solar power and a solar-boosted hot water system. There’s also the low water use garden and underground watering system. It’s fun for him; he’s an engineer with an energy conservation hobby.
 Nye is currently the Executive Director of The Planetary Society, the world’s largest space interest organization.

TRANSCRIPT:
Question: Hey Bill. So there are many videos online claiming to be extraterrestrial sightings. It just seems that the government is aware of extraterrestrials yet they reject the idea. Possibly they’re hiding the truth from us in fear of the knowledge greatly changing our daily lives. Do you believe these aliens exist and if so would you tell us?
Bill Nye: No I don’t believe the aliens exist coming to visit you and the government knows about it and hasn’t told you. No. Start with that. Two more things. First of all the whole alien thing really got revved up in 1947. There was a project called Sky Hook and the U.S. Government had these very cool super high altitude balloons and they were going to have a constellation of them or an armada of these balloons off the East Coast of the former Soviet Union with microphones tuned to listen for nuclear weapons tests. This was going to be big fun. And so they were testing the balloon in New Mexico and it was complicated and the winds blew the thing around and it crashed and it was impractical. The idea was kind of cool but it was a cold war idea that just didn’t work. Now this project was secret so yes, government people showed up. The U.S. Army swept up all the debris from the crash and took it away because it was secret.
And they also experimented with parachuting dummies from very high altitudes in the same area. And this has led to all these fabulous myths about aliens and the government knows stuff you don’t. Now I look like nobody and I am but I had an engineering job, several of them over the years, and during one of them I had security clearance. And I worked on a secret airplane for a little while and I never went myself but I worked with several guys, they were all men, who went to Area 51 to Groom Lake which is an Air Force base in Nevada where we fly around these secret airplanes. And it’s a real place. And these guys went there and when I was doing it it was called level five security clearance. I only had level four. I never went to Groom Lake. But t...

rkqUjeQNEQs,2011-08-18,"How cats become infected with feline coronavirus, the virus which causes FIP","Feline coronavirus (FCoV), which causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in a small percentage of infected cats, is shed in the faeces. FCoV infection occurs when cats ingest (or inhale) the virus. FCoV is very contagious and it only takes a tiny speck of contaminated cat litter to infect a kitten or cat. 
FCoV lasts up to 7 weeks in the house (it is not as stable as parvovirus, which survives for a year, but is more stable than feline herpesvirus which only survives ~12 hours). FCoV is protected by faeces and cat litter (unless it has anti-virus properties). Outdoors, cats bury their faeces and FCoV is rapidly broken down in the soil. Cats do not seek out each others’ faeces, as dogs do, so there is a good chance of the FCoV dying long before another cat is exposed to it.
In this animation we meet Augustus, a healthy FCoV-infected cat, and we see how his faeces contains billions of highly infectious virus particles. Augustus will shed virus in his faeces for a few weeks or months, then will stop shedding virus: nobody might ever know that he was infected. Enter Plato, an uninfected cat who has to share a litter tray with Augustus. Even if the tray has been de-clumped since Augustus used it, it will still contain enormous amounts of coronavirus. The virus gets onto Plato’s paws as he covers his own toilet, and when he grooms himself, he licks virus off his paws and swallows it. We believe that the virus first infects the cells lining the small intestine (i.e. the epithelial cells of the villi). Once a cat is infected with FCoV, a battle begins between the immune system and the virus. Happily most cats who become infected only shed the virus for a few weeks or months, then stop. However, an unfortunate 5-10% of FCoV-infected cats go on to develop FIP. 
The best way to prevent FCoV transmission is to ensure that you only bring FCoV-negative cats into your house. Allow your cats outdoors if it is safe to do so. If cats must be confined indoors, have at least one litter tray for every cat in the house—preferably in different rooms. There are cat flaps which recognise specific cat microchips: I use Staywell cat doors. Use covered or self-cleaning litter trays. Some people train their cats to use human toilets. It takes only a tiny speck of infected cat litter dust blown onto cat food for a cat to become infected, so keep food and water bowls as far away from litter trays as possible. In this animation there is an easily disinfected floor, and a dirt trapper mat placed near the litter tray, to capture microscopic particles of infected cat litter, but there are too few litter trays, so the cats had to share. 
THE BEST CAT LITTERS TO HELP PREVENT THIS VIRUS
Research at catvirus.com has shown that the type of cat litter you use will affect the transmission of FCoV between your cats. No litter completely prevents FCoV transmission, but using a cat litter which tracks minimally, and which has some anti-virus properties, helps: we found that the best litter was Dr Elsey's Cat Attract.  EverClean clumping and World's Best Cat Litter are also good. The worst litters for FCoV transmission are the wood pellets which turn into sawdust and track all over the house.

fxehTVbA-aI,2020-07-24,Boris Johnson calls anti-vaxxers ‘nuts’ and says we'll be past coronavirus by mid-2021,"Coronavirus latest - Boris Johnson has today blasted anti-vaxxers as ""nuts"" and urged everyone to get the flu vaccine this summer.

Adding, coronavirus will be with Britain until the ""middle of next year"" the Prime Minister has admitted.

The PM lashed out at those who don't get their jabs as the Government launched a huge new drive to try and protect the NHS this winter ahead of a possible second coronavirus wave.

Speaking to Sky News on a visit to a GP centre today, he said:

There's all these anti-vaxxers now.

""They are nuts, they are nuts.""

The Government is aiming to double its winter flu vaccination programme in England - with free shots for those aged 50 and over and 11-year-olds.

Last year, around 15 million people received a jab against seasonal flu but ministers hope this will rise to 30 million this winter.

Experts are concerned about the impact of a double whammy of Covid-19 cases and seasonal flu potentially overwhelming the NHS.

There are also worries that people could suffer both seasonal flu and Covid-19 at the same time.

He said today: ""We want everybody to get a flu jab in the run-up to this winter and that's why we're rolling out the biggest-ever programme of flu immunisation.

""And we're aiming first of all for schoolchildren up to year 7, for pregnant women, for people over 65, for people who are shielded, but then we will be extending it to people who are 50 to 65.

""Now the reason for doing this is to protect the NHS in the winter months because obviously we have still got Covid, we have still got the threat of a second spike on Covid, and it's vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab and I really hope everybody will.""

The Prime Minister said getting a flu jab is something that can help to ""protect the NHS"".

He told Sky News: ""I just urge everybody in those groups to do it.

""It is something you can do to protect yourself against flu but it's also something that we can all do to protect the NHS.""

Speaking on the first anniversary of becoming PM today, he said he believes that by the ""middle of next year"" Britain will be ""well on the way past"" COVID-19.

He previously had said he hoped by Christmas things would be almost back to normal.

He said: ""But I must be clear with people, I do still think that we have tough times ahead in keeping this virus under control,"" he said.

""We have tough times ahead in coming through economically.""

The PM refused to say when social distancing guidelines would be able to stop.

He added: ""The use of face masks, the use of all the social distancing measures really does depend on our ability collectively to get the pandemic right down and to keep it down.

""I'm not going to make a prediction about when these various social distancing measures will come off.""

Boris Johnson was asked about whether he thinks it is a good idea for the public to be ""shaming"" people who are not wearing masks in places where they should be wearing them.

He replied: ""I think we should rely on the massive common sense of the British people that have so far delivered the results that we've seen, and that's going to work.""

tlJXJ3BM7j0,2017-12-04,"Inside The Clean-Up Of Chernobyl, The World's Worst Nuclear Disaster (HBO)","At the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, workers are tackling the final preparations for a major milestone, slated for next year: handing over full control of the site to Ukraine. Chernobyl still holds the distinction of being the world’s worst nuclear disaster. And the job of containing the fallout has required an international cast of players. A year ago, crews finished putting the new sarcophagus in place. It’s a massive steel arch -- officially called the New Safe Confinement -- that covers the destroyed reactor. Now, workers are busy sealing up the space between the new sarcophagus and the old one-- which was built in the 80s. And they’re facing some of the highest levels of radiation they’ve encountered so far. Jake Hanrahan got an exclusive look.

n6QwnzbRUyA,2020-05-28,How coronavirus spreads outdoors vs. indoors,"Can a runner give you Covid-19?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you want to stay totally safe from Covid-19, and eliminate the risk of either getting it or transmitting it, you have to stay home. But as the weather gets warmer, public places start to open up, and many places enter their fourth month of life under coronavirus, that’s becoming less and less realistic.

At the same time, we know that coronavirus can be transmitted through the air -- and that raises some pretty big questions. Is it safe to go the beach? What about a park? Is a heavy-breathing runner going to infect you as they pass you? In short: How do you go outside safely?

Read Vox reporter Sigal Samuel’s article about the risks of transmitting Covid-19 outdoors: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/24/21233226/coronavirus-runners-cyclists-airborne-infectious-dose

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Kaku addresses the question ""What if Einstein's theory of relativity is wrong?""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MICHIO KAKU:

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

Michio Kaku: Many physicists had a heart attack when we got news from Geneva, Switzerland that Einstein might be wrong.  All hell broke loose in the physics community.  Every physicist I know was taking a position on this hot topic because relativity is the foundation of modern physics along with the Quantum Theory.  

Now what they found was if you take a beam of neutrinos from the atom smasher in Geneva, Switzerland, shoot the beam through the mountains from Switzerland to Italy over a distance of 454 miles, the neutrinos out-raced a light beam by a distance of 60 feet, 60 feet over a distance of 454 miles.  Well, that doesn’t sound like much, but to a physicist this is a disaster.  It means that the foundations of modern physics have to be called into question.
First, it means that time travel could become commonplace because as you approach the speed of light time slows down.  If you exceed the speed of light, time goes backwards.  Remember that scene in Superman One when Lois Lane dies and Superman goes into outer space and goes around the planet earth in the opposite direction; the earth stops and then rotates in the opposite direction and then, all of the sudden, Lois Lane springs back to life?  Well, that kind of scenario might be possible if the speed of light is not so special that particles can exceed the speed of light, not to mention that we’ll have to recalibrate everything - the age of the universe, the age of stars, the distance to the stars, the basic structure of modern electronics has to be changed, the GPS, nuclear weapons, all of that would have to be recalibrated and rethought through if Einstein’s theory of relativity is wrong.

So what’s the solution to the problem?  Well the solution to the problem is obviously they goofed.  They made a mistake.  I remember when I was a grad student years and years ago at Harvard.  My advisor at Harvard was Professor Pound and he the famous Pound-Rebka Experiment where they shot a light beam from the top of Jefferson Hall to the bottom of Jefferson Hall.  Now, there was a rival group, a rival group that also did the same experiment and they had to calculate the speed of light in the process.  They found that the speed of light actually rose in the morning, peaked at noontime.  Then the speed of light began to slow down at dinnertime and reached a minimum at midnight.  Well, this was shocking.  The speed of light, which governs the universe all of the sudden is wedded to lunchtime and dinnertime. So what's the problem?  The problem was that this counter experiment, this rival experiment, was done outdoors, and the sensors were temperature-dependent, and of course it’s warmer at lunchtime and colder at midnight.  Well, Professor Pound’s experiment was done indoors and therefore, didn’t have that kind of variation.  
The lesson here is: systematic errors creep into very delicate calculations.  Some people think they found the source of the error.  How do we know that from Switzerland to Italy the distance is 454 miles?  Well, you use GPS, right? Obvious, but GPS is a relativistic system.  It uses relativity and some physicists have claimed that they mis-calibrated the distance from the sensors to the satellite and satellite back down to Italy, a triangle; that one of the lengths of the triangle was mis-calibrated in the process of doing this experiment. 

Now, there is another counter example.  Back in 1987, light from a gigantic supernova in the Magellanic Clouds hit the planet earth and, simultaneously with that, neutrinos were detected in gigantic neutrino detectors in Japan.

kjhIn_AMihA,2016-12-02,"Explaining Mumps: Michael Cooperstock, MD","Mumps is a viral illness that can cause fever, body aches, headaches, fatigue, swelling of the salivary glands, or pain with chewing and swallowing. About a third of people who contract the mumps virus do not develop any symptoms.

Mumps is most commonly spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and a non-infected person inhales respirator droplets that contain the virus. Most mumps cases do not lead to serious complications.

zQGOcOUBi6s,2014-07-01,The Immune System Explained I – Bacteria Infection,"Every second of your life you are under attack. Bacteria, viruses, spores and more living stuff wants to enter your body and use its resources for itself. The immune system is a powerful army of cells that fights like a T-Rex on speed and sacrifices itself for your survival. Without it you would die in no time. This sounds simple but the reality is complex, beautiful and just awesome. An animation of the immune system.

Check out this episode of our new Quibi show, Answered. 
There's a new episode daily you can watch here: https://link.quibi.com/answeredbyvoxyt

As coronavirus lockdowns loosen, flights are starting to fill up — leading many people to call for empty middle seats. Keeping middle seats open on a plane can help maintain physical distance between passengers. But it’s unlikely to prevent virus transmission; there are many other ways coronavirus can spread on an airplane. One thing’s for sure, though: a vacant middle seat will definitely affect how much we pay to fly.

Laws that permit transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice? What if there were a better way?

Last year, VICE News went to McKinney, Texas to check out ""Conservative ""Move"" - a real estate company that says it has the solution to living a life free of liberals. They’ll try to find you a place to live, a job with a decent wage, and the best schools for your children, in Texas or any other Republican stronghold.

The United Arab Emirate's Hope satellite was despatched last week and now China has launched its first rover mission to the red planet.

Nasa's Perseverance Rover is scheduled to take off on 30th July.

Well, summer 2020 is a popular time for missions to the red planet because of the way the planets align - but how long does it take to get there?

Landing on Mars is known as the ""seven minutes of terror"", and there are lots of reasons why.

Here BBC Science Correspondent Laura Foster explains how long it takes to get there and why it's so difficult.

In US news and current events today, the Black Lives Matter protests and George Floyd protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd have opened up a new dialogue about systemic racism in America, though these problems have existed for centuries. In conversation with Cornel West, Eddie Glaude Jr. discusses the landmark 1994 essay by James Baldwin, The White Problem, as it affects America today. Speaking to Eddie Glaude, Cornel West evokes one of the greatest Black writers of all time in discussing the sinister lie that lies at the heart of racism and injustice in America, and as the BLM protests and Black Lives Matter movement continues to spread across the globe, Americans must come face to face with their own unjust actions and beliefs.

It's difficult to build a working four-rotor helicopter that spans 100 feet and only weighs 80 pounds. It's even harder when your engine is a 0.7-horsepower person. But one team of engineering students is trying to do just that.

TsUb-sialn8,2019-11-25,Dr. Anthony Fauci: The anti-vaxx movement is 'libertarianism taken to the extreme',"Long-time head of the infectious disease institute at NIH, Dr. Anthony Fauci denounces the anti-vaccine movement that has led to upticks in cases of illnesses like measles. He tells Ian Bremmer that not only are most beliefs about the perceived dangers of vaccines misguided and inaccurate, they put large swaths of communities at risk.

The “Spanish flu” virus of 1918 killed an estimated 50 million people, more than all the deaths in World War I combined. While global public health efforts have greatly improved mortality rates in more modern outbreaks, experts say the next pandemic is a matter of “when,” not “if.” In this episode, Ian Bremmer takes a look how diseases spread and become global. His guest, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is a leading epidemiologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH.
 
Dr. Fauci breaks down some of the biggest health threats facing the world today: HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and the recent rise in cases of measles brought on by the misguided anti-vaccine movement.
 
Also on the show: Five years after his Ebola diagnosis made international news, NYC’s Dr. Craig Spencer tells GZERO Media what he learned from the experience and what his life is like today.

a1krYDmhr0Q,2020-08-14,UK to ease COVID-19 lockdown further whilst raising fines for mask offences,"The UK’s coronavirus restrictions will continue to be lifted on Saturday, with a series of businesses now being able to open their doors again. Casinos, soft-play centres, theatres, bowling alleys, music venues and comedy clubs will all be able to operate on Saturday. However they must adhere to social distancing and hygiene rules to limit the potential spread of coronavirus. Face masks must also be worn in indoors venues including conference centres.

New rules also mean that wedding receptions of up to 30 people are now permitted and beauty salons will be able to offer treatments which were banned previously, including facials, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments and more. 

Most businesses were able to open in July, however the government kept certain companies closed which involved close contact between people or were harder to prevent the virus from spreading. The easing of restrictions were meant to take place at the beginning of August, however Boris Johnson delayed this decision due to rising cases across the country. Several regions were also placed under lockdowns, including Leicester and the Greater Manchester area where coronavirus was spreading quickly. The new loosening of regulations will not apply to those areas where local lockdowns are in place, such as Preston.

As they say, there is always “truth in comedy” and these tweets were no exception. For instance, it’s true, you don’t HAVE to get weighed when you come in for a routine checkup. I also talk about sleep apnea/CPAP machines, as well as weight loss surgery. Bear popped in to say hello too   :)

The coronavirus has had an enormous impact on our lives: how we work, communicate and congregate. At this point, we’re familiar with how to protect ourselves from the virus – and the disease it causes, COVID-19 – by washing our hands thoroughly, wearing masks and social distancing.

Most people who get the virus are mildly sick and will recover at home. For others, the virus can be severe, even fatal.

One significant way the virus attacks is deep in our lungs.

---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:

https://www.kqed.org/science/1963200/how-covid-19-attacks-your-lungs

--- What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?
The Center for Disease Control advises on its website that “symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19: Cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Or at least two of these symptoms: fever; chills; Repeated shaking with chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell.” 

--- How can I protect myself from the coronavirus?
The Center for Disease Control has a comprehensive list of guidelines at cdc.gov, but the main tips to remember are: wash your hands often; avoid close contact with other people; cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover (like a mask or bandanna) when around others; cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow; regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in your home.

--- If you’ve had the new coronavirus, are you now immune?
The Center for Disease Control states on its website: “We do not know yet if having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from getting infected with that virus again, or how long that protection might last. Scientists are doing studies to answer those questions.”

It sounds concerning — if the virus is changing, that could imply that it’s getting worse. That’s not the case. Although it’s true that the coronavirus is mutating, that doesn’t mean it’s getting more dangerous. In fact, it can help us in our battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s how.

Officials in anti-vaccination ‘hotspot’ near Portland declare an emergency over measles outbreak

A quickly escalating measles outbreak around Portland, Ore., has led health officials in nearby Clark County, Wash., to declare a public health emergency as they warn that people infected with the highly contagious virus have visited schools and churches, a dentist’s office, a Costco, an Ikea and an Amazon locker pickup station.

Someone with measles was at Concourse D of the Portland International Airport on Jan. 7, the county’s public health department advised. An infected person attended a Portland Trail Blazers home game Jan. 11.

At the beginning of last week, there were only a handful of confirmed cases. On Friday, the day the emergency was declared, there were 19. By Sunday, that number had grown to 21. The latest update came Tuesday, when county officials said they had confirmed 23 cases and were investigating two more suspected cases. The vast majority of those who have fallen ill had not been immunized.

FC4soCjxSOQ,2020-02-13,What is CORONAVIRUS? AND How to PROTECT YOURSELF?,"The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Expert Body on Coronavirus has released guidance for General Public and healthcare professionals on the symptoms of the virus.

What Signs and Symptoms should you look out for
A person could be at risk if they have any or all of the Following:
Fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as coughing or difficulty breathing, after travelling to Wuhan or having close contact with someone who was ill and is now under investigation for the virus in the past two weeks.
Fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness after having close contact in the past two weeks with someone who's been confirmed to have the virus.
The CDC defined ""close contact"" as being within about 6 feet (1.8 m) ""or within the room or care area"" of a person with the coronavirus for a prolonged period without appropriate protective clothing, or ""having direct contact with infectious secretions"" of a person with the virus without protective clothing.

Which People should be Extra Careful:
Coronaviruses are particularly dangerous for people who have weaker immune systems, like young children and older adults

How to protect yourself
To protect yourself from the virus: 
Try to avoid contact with people who display symptoms similar to those of pneumonia or the common cold, like coughing or a runny nose.
Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, and scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when possible.
Avoid animals and animal markets.
The only current treatment for Coronavirus being offered is Supportive in Nature. If you notice any of these signs and Symptoms please contact your nearest Professional Healthcare setup. Share this video to help spread this information to those you love.

QXT4OVM4vXI,2013-07-16,Atomic Hook-Ups - Types of Chemical Bonds: Crash Course Chemistry #22,"Atoms are a lot like us - we call their relationships ""bonds,"" and there are many different types. Each kind of atomic relationship requires a different type of energy, but they all do best when they settle into the lowest stress situation possible. The nature of the bond between atoms is related to the distance between them and, like people, it also depends on how positive or negative they are. Unlike human relationships, we can analyze exactly what makes chemical relationships work, and that's what this episode is all about. 

If you are paying attention, you will learn that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy difference between two atoms or ions; that those chemical bonds may be covalent if atoms share electrons, and that covalent bonds can share those electrons evenly or unevenly; that bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are transferred instead of shared: and how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb's Law. 

Pssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode! Find them on the free Crash Course App!

HrUYKKaUDHo,2019-04-04,This County Banned Unvaccinated Kids From Public Spaces (HBO),"Joe Hendrick’s sons are part of a growing number of children in the US who have not been vaccinated. Their family has decided against vaccines for reasons that mix a firm belief in personal freedom with scientifically-unconfirmed concerns about what’s inside vaccines. But unlike most unvaccinated families, Joe’s family is facing a first-of-its-kind ultimatum: get your kids vaccinated or keep the out of all public places.

Last week, Rockland County, New York instituted a thirty day ban on unvaccinated children in public spaces, including schools. The county declared a state of emergency after six months of uncooperative people hanging up the phone, closing the door on inspectors, and refusing to report cases.

Dr. Patricia Ruppert, the Rockland County Health Commissioner, says there have been 161 confirmed cases of measles and that there are likely many more that they don’t know about. While 98% of the cases to date have been among Orthodox Jewish residents who live in tight-knit enclaves, the health department is fighting to communicate to the county that every single unvaccinated person, regardless of faith, bears responsibility for potential spread.

In the interim, Joe Hendrick has chosen homeschooling over vaccination. He's now juggling that with his job and a two-week old newborn child. When asked if having a new baby had given him any second thoughts, Joe explained that he felt emboldened. ""I'd rather move and make sure my family is safe and, you know, we have the right to choose for ourselves instead of being forced into something that could potentially hurt my child.""

VICE News traveled to Rockland County, where officials are trying to reach people who have put personal choice over public health.

For months, Hong Kong was seen as an example of how a community could successfully contain Covid-19. The city was quick to isolate and trace infections and implemented measures to keep the public safe, moves which kept the number of cases relatively low. But after three weeks of zero local infections, Covid-19 cases in the city started to soar and Hong Kong entered its ""third wave."" So what happened to change things so suddenly?

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

Toll Like Receptors: The GateKeepers of Innate Immunity
 
Innate immunity as the first line of defense 
The innate immune system is an ancient host defense mechanism found in almost every multicellular organism from plants to humans. In invertebrates it is the sole mechanism of defense against pathogens but in higher vertebrates constitutes the first line of defense. The role of the innate immune system is not an insignificant one; not only must it discriminate between self and non-self as well as distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes, it also plays an important role in triggering and optimizing the adaptive immune response. This remarkable system allows an immediate non-specific response against microorganisms whereas the adaptive immunity mounts a specific response against the invading pathogen during the late phase of the infection.",IMGENEX,UCenM2tBeoH-m6tbuuVfKPew,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCenM2tBeoH-m6tbuuVfKPew,1299323.0,367.0,10347.0,330.0,[],"['Immune response', 'TLR', 'Toll Like Receptors', 'immunology', 'Antibodies', 'antibody', 'Toll-like Receptor', 'medical', 'animation', 'Response', 'Immune', 'pathogen', 'antigen', 'cell', 'cellular', 'Medicine', 'Cell (biology)', 'Health', 'blood', 'Leukocytes', 'protein', 'macrophage', 'proteins']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVMIZy-Y3f8/sddefault.jpg,,,,,covid-19,pseudoscience,

A woman in California is claiming she’s owed half the money a Starbucks Barista has received through GoFundMe because they’re using her name to profit. If you’ve yet to hear about the incident, a woman named Amber Lynn Gillies, who is now being referred to as Karen, allegedly claimed she didn’t need to wear a mask in a Starbucks, which is legally required in the state of California. After Barista Lenin Guiterrez asked Amber if she had a mask, she allegedly flipped him off, started swearing at people, while calling everyone sheep and said she doesn’t need a mask. Amber then left the store, returned shortly after, took a picture of Lenin and claimed she’d be calling corporate. Amber’s story would go viral, after a facebook post, but now she’s likely regretting her decision, as it seems she’s been getting a lot of hate, while Lenin has been getting a lot of praise. I’m gonna tell you guys all about it right now on InformOverload.
