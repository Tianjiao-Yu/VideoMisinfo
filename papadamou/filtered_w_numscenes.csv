np5x0UJB3f8,2020-08-17,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: State gyms can reopen with coronavirus precautions as soon as Aug. 24,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that gyms across the state, which have remained closed for about five months, can resume indoor operations with some new precautions as soon as next week.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday that gyms across the state can resume indoor operations with new precautions as soon as next week after being closed for about five months, .

Cuomo said gyms will be allowed to resume operations at 33% capacity. He added that gyms must comply with state health requirements, which will be released later Monday. Clients and staff will need to wear masks inside the facilities, and gyms will be subject to new ventilation requirements. 

While gyms will be subject to new restrictions, the reopening is another step towards normalcy in New York, which has managed to keep the level of Covid-19 spread low throughout the state while continuing to gradually reopen parts of the economy. The state, which was one of the first in the U.S. to be hit by the coronavirus and endured one of the most deadly outbreaks yet, is now charting a path forward. 

“The gyms can open as soon as August 24,” Cuomo said at a news briefing. “The guidance goes out today on gyms. Basically, the outline is 33% capacity. There are health requirements that are in the guidelines that have to be maintained to their ventilation requirements. This is a whole new topic where we can do a whole lot of good work.”

Shares of Planet Fitness were 1.7% in Monday afternoon trading.

“We look forward to working with our franchisees to safely reopen our locations in New York under Governor Cuomo’s guidelines, in order to provide New Yorkers with much needed access to high quality, affordable health and fitness,” the company said in a statement to CNBC.

Cuomo added that local officials must inspect gyms before they reopen or within two weeks of their opening “to make sure they’re meeting all the requirements.” He said localities have until Sept. 2 to inspect the gyms and determine whether they can reopen if they’re unable to do so before Aug. 24.

“The state will make, frankly, the hard decisions. I’ll say the businesses have to close. I’ll say the gyms have to close. I’ll say the bars have to close. Let them blame me,” Cuomo said. “You, local governments, have to do the compliance and enforcement work.”

He acknowledged that gym owners will likely criticize the state’s health requirements as too difficult, but added that the guidelines were crafted by health officials and engineers. He said gyms are an “area of concern” and “that’s why we went slow on it.”

“If it’s not done right, it can be a problem and we’ve seen that,” he said about reopening gyms. “You need to get the economy back up, you need to get life moving forward. That’s the constant tension you’re trying to walk and so far we’ve walked it right.”

Another reason why the state is ready to allow gyms to reopen, Cuomo said, is because everyone signs into gyms, which allows for effective contact tracing if there is a cluster of infections traced back to a gym. He added that the state’s low overall infection rate means that residents can safely do more activities without risking a massive outbreak.

Cuomo said 0.7% of all coronavirus tests in New York came back positive on Sunday, the most recent data available, adding that the state has averaged below 1% of positive tests since June. He added that six people died of Covid-19 on Sunday, far below the more than 800 daily deaths the state was seeing at the peak of the outbreak in April. 

New York, once the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, has made strides in beating back the initial outbreak and keeping the daily infection rate low compared with many other states. Still, the virus has infected more than 425,500 people and killed at least 32,800 people in the state, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

a1krYDmhr0Q,2020-08-14,UK to ease COVID-19 lockdown further whilst raising fines for mask offences,"The UK’s coronavirus restrictions will continue to be lifted on Saturday, with a series of businesses now being able to open their doors again. Casinos, soft-play centres, theatres, bowling alleys, music venues and comedy clubs will all be able to operate on Saturday. However they must adhere to social distancing and hygiene rules to limit the potential spread of coronavirus. Face masks must also be worn in indoors venues including conference centres.

New rules also mean that wedding receptions of up to 30 people are now permitted and beauty salons will be able to offer treatments which were banned previously, including facials, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments and more. 

Most businesses were able to open in July, however the government kept certain companies closed which involved close contact between people or were harder to prevent the virus from spreading. The easing of restrictions were meant to take place at the beginning of August, however Boris Johnson delayed this decision due to rising cases across the country. Several regions were also placed under lockdowns, including Leicester and the Greater Manchester area where coronavirus was spreading quickly. The new loosening of regulations will not apply to those areas where local lockdowns are in place, such as Preston.

Xj1nUFFVK1E,2020-02-25,HOW DOES COVID-19 AFFECT THE BODY?,"Coronaviruses (CoV) are a family of viruses that cause sicknesses like the common cold, as well as more severe diseases, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain – one that hasn’t previously been recognized in humans.
Coronaviruses cause diseases in mammals and birds. A zoonotic virus is one that is transmitted between animals and people. When a virus circulating in animal populations infects people, this is termed a “spillover event”.
How does CoVID-19 affect the body? The virus is fitted with protein spikes sticking out of the envelope that forms the surface and houses a core of genetic material. Any virus that enters your body looks for cells with compatible receptors – ones that allow it to invade the cell. Once they find the right cell, they enter and use the cell’s replication machinery to create copies of themselves. It is likely that COVID-19 uses the same receptor as SARS – found in both lungs and small intestines.
It is thought that CoVID-19 shares many similarities with SARS, which has three phases of attack: viral replication, hyper-reactivity of the immune system, and finally pulmonary destruction. Early on in infection, the coronavirus invades two types of cells in the lungs – mucus and cilia cells. Mucus keeps your lungs from drying out and protects them from pathogens. Cilia beat the mucus towards the exterior of your body, clearing debris – including viruses! – out of your lungs. Cilia cells were the preferred hosts of SARS-CoV, and are likely the preferred hosts of the new coronavirus. When these cells die, they slough off into your airways, filling them with debris and fluid. Symptoms include a fever, cough, and breathing difficulties. Many of those infected get pneumonia in both their lungs.
Enter the immune system. Immune cells recognize the virus and flood into the lungs. The lung tissue becomes inflamed. During normal immune function, the inflammatory process is highly regulated and is confined to infected areas. However, sometimes the immune system overreacts, and this results in damage to healthy tissue. More cells die and slough off into the lungs, further clogging them and worsening the pneumonia.
As damage to the lungs increases, stage three begins, potentially resulting in respiratory failure. Patients that reach this stage of infection can incur permanent lung damage or even die. We see the same lesions in the lungs of those infected by the novel coronavirus as those with SARS. SARS creates holes in the lungs, so they look honeycomb-like. This is probably due to the aforementioned over-reactive immune response, which affects tissue both infected and healthy and creates scars that stiffen the lungs. As such, some patients may require ventilators to aid breathing.
The inflammation also results in more permeable alveoli. This is the location of the thin interface of gas exchange, where your lungs replace carbon dioxide in your blood with fresh oxygen you just inhaled. Increased permeability causes fluid to leak into the lungs. This decreases the lungs’ ability to oxygenate blood, and in severe cases, floods them so that you become unable to breathe. Sometimes, this can be fatal.
The immune system’s over-reaction can also cause another kind of damage. Proteins called cytokines are the immune system’s alarm system, recruiting immune cells to the infection site. Over-production of cytokines can result in a cytokine storm, where there is large-scale inflammation in the body. Blood vessels become more permeable and fluid seeps out. This makes it difficult for blood and oxygen to reach the rest of the body and can result in multi-organ failure. This has happened in the most severe cases of CoVid-19. Although there are no specific treatments for coronaviruses, symptoms can be treated through supportive care. Also, vaccines are currently in development.
What can you do to protect yourself from CoVid-19? Basic protocol comes down to regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with anyone coughing or sneezing, avoiding unnecessary contact with animals, washing hands after contact with animals, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs prior to consumption, and covering your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing. Respiratory viruses are typically transmitted via droplets in sneezes or coughs of those infected, so preventing their travel stops the spread of disease.

vlOMghih_sM,2020-08-14,Should the COVID-19 vaccine be patent-free?,"The race is on for what some argue will be the most coveted resource of our time: a COVID-19 vaccine. 

It’s not just about the health of people, but getting economies going again. And geopolitics is shaping the decisions around who will get the vaccine first. 

Canada is among many rich nations that have taken a gamble on pharmaceutical companies and have pre-ordered millions of vaccines -- in the hopes that one will be successful. 

But some in the international community worry it leaves developing countries in the dark and have advocated for any successful vaccine to be patent-free. But how would that work and would it be realistic?

In this video, AMBOSS presents care providers with an overview of sampling both the nasopharynx and oropharynx in suspected COVID-19 cases, an acute respiratory illness associated with infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While a nasopharyngeal swab is the preferred testing method of the WHO and CDC, an oropharyngeal swab can also be conducted if necessary. When performing either type of swab, special care should be taken to reduce the risk of infection and ensure the reliability of swab results.

udprEtDVmIY,2020-03-26,My Family Has Mild Coronavirus.  Here's Our Home Covid-19 Treatment Plan,"It’s hard to escape news on the Coronavirus and get sucked in by the latest updates.  The fear and anxiety levels are high.  People are getting sick. We have gone into self-quarantine, canceled events, canceled travel, work from home, look suspiciously at anyone who sneezes or coughs.  When I sneeze, I look up coronavirus symptoms on Google.   Is it like Ebola, Zika virus, Parainfluenza, h1n1 virus?  It is a viral infection and an airborne disease that we need to take serious precautions but many people have gone overboard.   

Well, the coronavirus has hit home for us.  My daughter had it and now my husband has it.   They were put into self-quarantine where they are in their own separate room.  Self-isolation is one of the ways to contain the disease. We have had to make many adjustments in our routines but so far, I have managed to stay healthy.  Today I share some of things we have done to contain the disease so that I have managed to stay healthy (i may be asymptomatic who knows), treat my family members who are sick and create routine so that perhaps if you find you are going through a similar experience you can find ways to treat at home and get through this.

U8r3oTVMtQ0,2020-04-25,Recognizing Day to Day Signs and Symptoms of Coronavirus,"DAY TO DAY SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 
Before proceeding, please note that this general overview is compiled for initial self-assessment only and may vary for each individual. If you're not feeling well, you should immediately consult a medical practitioner to have an accurate diagnosis and proper treatment of COVID-19.
The typical daily symptoms are concluded from the study of 138 patients at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and another study involving 135 patients from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 patients from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital.
These symptoms are broken down into:
DAY 1 TO DAY 2
The beginning symptoms are similar to the common cold with a mild sore throat and neither having a fever nor feeling tired. Patients can still consume food and drink as usual.
DAY 3
The patient's throats start to feel a bit painful. Body temperature reads at around 36.5° celsius. Although it's uncommon, other symptoms like mild nausea, vomiting or mild diarrhea are possible to set in. 
DAY 4
Throat pain becomes more serious. Other symptoms like feeling weak and joint pain start to manifest. The patient may show a temperature reading between 36.5° to 37° celsius.
DAY 5 TO 6
Mild fever starts. The patients show a temperature reading above 37.2° celsius. The second most common symptom, dry cough, also appears. Dyspnea or breathing difficulty may occur occasionally. Most patients in this stage are easily feeling tired. Other symptoms remain about the same. These four symptoms are among the top five key indications of COVID-19 according to the final report of the initial outbreak conducted by the joint mission of China and WHO.
DAY 7
The patients that haven't started recovering by day 7 get more serious coughs and breathing difficulty. Fever can get higher up to 38° celsius. Patients may develop further headache and body pain or worsening diarrhea if there’s any. Many patients are admitted to the hospital at this stage. 
DAY 8 TO 9 
On the 8th day, the symptoms are likely to be worsened for the patient who has coexisting medical conditions. Severe shortness of breath becomes more frequent. Temperature reading goes well above 38°. In one of the studies, day 9 is the average time when Sepsis starts to affect 40% of the patients.
DAY 10 TO 11
Doctors are ordering imaging tests like chest x-ray to capture the severity of respiratory distress in patients. Patients are having loss of appetite and may be facing abdominal pain. The condition also needs immediate treatment in ICU. 
DAY 12 TO 14
For the survivors, the symptoms can be well-managed at this point. Fever tends to get better and breathing difficulties may start to cease on day 13. But Some patients may still be affected by mild cough even after hospital discharge.  
DAY 15 TO 16
Day 15 is the opposite condition for the rest of the minority patients . The fragile group must prepare for the possibility of acute cardiac injury or kidney injury. 
DAY 17 TO 19
COVID-19 fatality cases happen at around day 18. Before the time, vulnerable patients may develop a secondary infection caused by a new pathogen in the lower respiratory tract. The severe condition may then lead to a blood coagulation and ischemia.
DAY 20 TO 22
The surviving patients are recovered completely from the disease and are discharged from the hospital.

BIymfznD7YA,2020-03-17,COVID-19 Update 8: Zinc and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19?,"We have been asked again and again - “What else can I do, apart from social distancing, hand hygiene, and so on, to protect myself from COVID-19?” There are additional actions that can be taken.

In this video we examine some details about the virus in Korea and how they are handling things differently. We  take a look at the biology of the virus. We examine what happens when our cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2. And finally, we review a study that suggests the possible use of zinc and chloroquine in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.

0ts8X3HDtPE,2020-03-30,Doctor Shares The Biggest Lie About COVID-19 | UK Data,"There has been a particularly harmful misconception which has led many to believe coronavirus is a trivial problem that won't affect them.

These are results from the first 775 patients admitted to intensive care in the UK, with COVID-19.

Time to put the misconception that this disease only preys on the elderly and those with significant medical conditions, to rest.

Erratum: Thanks to a couple of friends who pointed out that I should've been clearer with the deaths statistic - when saying around half have died, that refers to those with outcomes recorded, ie patients who have either left ICU alive or dead. Many of these patients are still in ICU right now, so the rate may change *however* if you click the link below you can see a steady state emerging between discharge alive and dead, suggesting the 52:48 ratio is probably about right.

229Fi8fOtho,2020-04-13,Coronavirus: Why Germany has been so successful in dealing with COVID-19,"A look at why Germany has been so successful in dealing with the pandemic, and has been able to keep its coronavirus death rate so low, compared to other nations, with Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister.

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others.

But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors.

In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany’s decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.’s decision to only test symptomatic cases.

Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany’s less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors.

“I think so far we’ve been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,” he told CNBC Thursday.

Support Vox by joining the Video Lab at http://vox.com/join or making a one-time contribution: http://vox.com/contribute

Much of the data about the coronavirus epidemic and covid-19 is flawed. It is collected and reported in different ways by different countries, and almost certainly undercounts the number of cases and deaths. But organizations and journalists still need to report the available data to inform the public and help guide policymakers. Much of that data ends up in visualizations, like charts and maps, which can make it easier to understand and analyze.

But it's important to know how the process of data visualization can shape our perception of the crisis. In this video, we deconstruct one particularly popular chart of covid-19 cases around the world which uses a logarithmic scale, and explain how to avoid being misled by it.

Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has similar symptoms to the flu. They also spread in similar ways. So it's natural to want to compare the two. But Covid-19 is very different, in ways that make it much more dangerous. And understanding how is key to understanding why we have to take it so seriously.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you want to stay totally safe from Covid-19, and eliminate the risk of either getting it or transmitting it, you have to stay home. But as the weather gets warmer, public places start to open up, and many places enter their fourth month of life under coronavirus, that’s becoming less and less realistic.

At the same time, we know that coronavirus can be transmitted through the air -- and that raises some pretty big questions. Is it safe to go the beach? What about a park? Is a heavy-breathing runner going to infect you as they pass you? In short: How do you go outside safely?

Read Vox reporter Sigal Samuel’s article about the risks of transmitting Covid-19 outdoors: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/24/21233226/coronavirus-runners-cyclists-airborne-infectious-dose

r2fxJI_cP58,2020-08-12,The risky way to speed up a coronavirus vaccine,"A Covid-19 vaccine could take a long time. Some scientists are proposing a controversial plan that could get us one faster. 

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

With thousands of people dying of Covid-19 every day, the sooner a vaccine can be deemed safe and effective, the better. But vaccine development is a lengthy process that isn’t easy to rush, and that’s in part because of the final step in testing any vaccine: the phase III trial. Phase III requires tens of thousands of volunteers, each of whom get either a placebo or an experimental vaccine. The problem is the next part: Vaccine developers have to wait until a statistically significant number of them, going about their lives normally, eventually get naturally infected. This can take years.

To speed that up, some epidemiologists and scientists are calling for something called a human challenge trial, in which a subject who has been given the vaccine is deliberately infected. This isn’t a new concept; human challenge trials have been used to develop vaccines or treatments for lots of diseases, like cholera, typhoid, malaria, influenza, and common cold viruses. But what sets Covid-19 apart from those diseases is that it currently has no effective treatment. Because it’s so new, we also aren’t fully aware of its long-term health effects. Unlike other human challenge trials, a Covid-19 challenge trial would entail a risk of serious illness — and even death.

It’s because of those risks that a Covid-19 challenge trial would be limited to the young and healthy, who would be at the lowest risk of harm. But there are questions beyond the ethics. Would artificially infecting someone in a lab setting provide useful information on how to prevent natural infection? Would a study performed on only young and healthy people produce a vaccine that works for everyone? And with some vaccines already far along in their phase III trials, would a human challenge trial do any good at this point? 

Even though no Covid-19 human challenge trials are currently planned, more than 30,000 people from nearly 150 countries have already said they would volunteer for one if the opportunity presented itself. The question is, should we let them?

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.
Previous headline: Would you volunteer to get Covid-19?

In this video, you will learn about the symptoms associated with COVID-19. They are quite a bit different from a regular cold. The disease seems to start with a fever, followed by a dry cough.

Around 80% of confirmed cases are mild and can stay home whereas 20% are more severe and need inpatient care. 

We also discuss a paper published in the respected journal The Lancet that describes the clinical course of 99 cases hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia.

Even after the billions of people under lockdown will be able to resume their life, we will not be able to travel that freely or enjoy the supply chains of the world so easily. Sustainability, solidarity, and healthcare will finally take center stage. 

There will be changes at every level of our lives. Maybe we should forget about handshakes forever. Maybe we will see people wearing masks everywhere. And we will unintentionally keep our distance and be more cautious around our elderly. New habits will arise from properly washing hands to better overall hygiene and to entirely new travel habits.

In this video, I talk about exciting topics such as: 
- the concept of immunity passport and new ways of traveling
- whether online meetings, classes, and remote work will become the new default
- how artificial intelligence will take a larger role in healthcare
- the importance of portable, point-of-care devices
- the future of the doctor-patient relationship

... and various other things. Check them out, and share your opinion about these in a comment!

A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with the video. Especially “Our World in Data”, the online publication for research and data on the world’s largest problems – and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona Pandemic.

In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the “Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2”, that causes the disease called COVID19, and that everyone simply calls Coronavirus.

What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do?

dSQztKXR6k0,2020-03-16,Why fighting the coronavirus depends on you,"If we can slow the virus down, it could save hundreds of thousands of lives.

Read more about the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic at http://vox.com/coronavirus

In March 2020, the World Health Organization officially classified Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, as a pandemic. That means the disease no longer constitutes just an outbreak or even an epidemic; the coronavirus has now spread around the world, and will continue to reach into other countries and communities.

That’s in part because of how contagious the virus is. When you’re infected with the flu, it takes about two days before you start to show symptoms. But coronavirus symptoms take an average of five to six days to appear, so it’s easy to spread well before you notice that you’re feeling sick. Many people are spreading it while going about their daily lives as usual.

The risk is that once coronavirus starts to spread in a community, about 20% of cases are severe and may require hospitalization. As those cases multiply, hospitals can fill up quickly. And people with severe cases of COVID-19 who can’t receive proper medical attention are at a much higher risk of dying.

Ideally, we would be able to stop the virus from spreading entirely. We can’t do that right now. What we can do is slow it down, so that the severe cases get spread out over a longer period of time, and hospitals are less likely to be overwhelmed on any given day. And that’s where each one of us comes in. The best way to slow down the spread is for everyone — healthy, sick, young, old — to limit social contact as much as possible, immediately. This is called social distancing, and it only works if enough of us do it. But if we do, it could mean the difference between the life and death of someone you know.

TPpoJGYlW54,2020-03-06,How wildlife trade is linked to coronavirus,"And why the disease first appeared in China.

NOTE: As our expert Peter Li points out in the video, “The majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful –a small minority.”  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.

You can find further reading on this on Vox:  
https://www.vox.com/2020/2/7/21126758/coronavirus-xenophobia-racism-china-asians
https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/4/21157825/coronavirus-pandemic-xenophobia-racism
https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/3/6/21166625/coronavirus-photos-racism

As of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.

Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the ""coronavirus"" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

kwkvTBgTO7A,2020-07-29,What Does America’s Coronavirus Response Look Like Abroad? | NYT Opinion,"The United States leads the world in Covid-19 deaths, nearing 150,000 lost lives. The unemployment figures brought on by the pandemic are mind-boggling. The Trump administration’s slow and haphazard response has been widely criticized. But what does it look like to young people around the world, whose governments moved quickly and aggressively to contain the coronavirus?

We wanted to know, so we reached out to quite a few and showed them charts, facts, photos and videos illustrating the U.S. response. Spoiler: They were not impressed.

Many advanced economies, from Germany to Singapore, directly supplemented salaries to save jobs. Other nations with fewer resources started mass testing at the first sign of an outbreak. Many countries mandated universal lockdowns — and successfully flattened the curve. In some parts of Europe, you could be fined for straying too far from your home. And Vietnam, a nation of 95 million people, has not seen a single Covid-19 death.

This Opinion video is a follow-up to a popular video we produced last year, which asked young Europeans to respond to American policies such as health care and parental leave. Many comments suggested we produce a sequel. Well, here it is — the Covid-19 edition.

As the rate of new coronavirus cases in the US slows down, many states and cities there are encouraging businesses to open again, easing the lockdowns that have been in place since March. But public health experts warn that in many of those places, opening up is premature.

The reason is that throughout the US, as well as in many other countries, we still don’t really know how many people have the virus, or where they are. That’s dangerous because it means infected people who don’t feel sick are probably mingling with the rest of the population, which could enable further outbreaks. And the only way to really prevent that is by proactively testing people for covid-19 until the people who have it have been tracked down and isolated.

The US started testing its population for covid-19 very slowly, but it’s since ramped testing up, and by early May was performing over 200,000 tests a day. Unfortunately, there’s no magic number of tests that is “enough” to contain an outbreak. The important thing is to test the right people — and to evaluate whether that’s happening, public health officials recommend looking at a different number: The percentage of tests coming back positive. It’s called the test positivity rate.

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.

D9tTi-CDjDU,2020-05-14,What is a coronavirus? - Elizabeth Cox,"Dig into the science of coronaviruses and find out how they cause diseases such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. 

--

For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains and most isolated caverns. They finally found it in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. So what exactly is a coronavirus, and how does it spread? Elizabeth Cox explains.

Recently the WHO named the outbreak a pandemic and now globally cases are rising sharply, outstripping the Chinese cases. 
As the outbreak of the disease is reaching a high number of countries all over the world, the general public awareness and scientific interest are also on the rise. Currently, the virus virulence, how it is transmitted between humans and the possible treatments of the disease are being actively studied. As there is already a lot of information available, we have here gathered the known information on the molecular organization and structure of the virus, thus creating a dynamic and scientific accurate 3D animation of SARS-CoV-2! 
We hope you like it! If so, please support our work by subscribing to our channel and visit our website focused on 3D animations of diverse biological processes: http://visual.biolution.net.
Thank you!

Correction:
The video mentions that ACE2 cleaves the spike protein, however a publication published on March 5, 2020 showed that cleavage by the protease TPMSSR2 is required for priming the spike protein for viral entry: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.052
Thanks to Mikail Dogan, norm1124 and Levent Cavas  for pointing this out!
We also apologise for referring to the hemagglutinin protein, which is of SARS-CoV. Instead SARS-CoV-2 contains a so called M Protein in the envelope. A correct Figure is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7097337/figure/Fig3/

FC4soCjxSOQ,2020-02-13,What is CORONAVIRUS? AND How to PROTECT YOURSELF?,"The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Expert Body on Coronavirus has released guidance for General Public and healthcare professionals on the symptoms of the virus.

What Signs and Symptoms should you look out for
A person could be at risk if they have any or all of the Following:
Fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as coughing or difficulty breathing, after travelling to Wuhan or having close contact with someone who was ill and is now under investigation for the virus in the past two weeks.
Fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness after having close contact in the past two weeks with someone who's been confirmed to have the virus.
The CDC defined ""close contact"" as being within about 6 feet (1.8 m) ""or within the room or care area"" of a person with the coronavirus for a prolonged period without appropriate protective clothing, or ""having direct contact with infectious secretions"" of a person with the virus without protective clothing.

Which People should be Extra Careful:
Coronaviruses are particularly dangerous for people who have weaker immune systems, like young children and older adults

How to protect yourself
To protect yourself from the virus: 
Try to avoid contact with people who display symptoms similar to those of pneumonia or the common cold, like coughing or a runny nose.
Don't touch your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, and scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when possible.
Avoid animals and animal markets.
The only current treatment for Coronavirus being offered is Supportive in Nature. If you notice any of these signs and Symptoms please contact your nearest Professional Healthcare setup. Share this video to help spread this information to those you love.

P27HRClMf2U,2020-04-22,What face masks actually do against coronavirus,"Face masks don't make you invincible.

Support Vox by joining the Video Lab at http://vox.com/join or making a one-time contribution: http://vox.com/contribute

The fight against coronavirus is global. But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.

Here’s where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether masks can protect healthy people from getting Covid-19.

The truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won’t get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they’re most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.

But experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks is a lot easier to answer when you consider one of Covid-19’s most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease’s long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it’s almost impossible to be completely sure that you don’t already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.

NQ0FaaJ73xc,2020-06-24,18 COVID Autopsies - This is what they found in the Brain 😱,"18 COVID Autopsies - This is what they found in the Brain 😱

If you've seen my previous videos on autopsies done on COVID patients, it's pretty clear by now that when patients die of this covid, it's because of the lungs. The lungs' inflammation, pneumonia, and cytokine storm and ARDS, sometimes with multiorgan failure or the major blood clot, develop in the lungs. Sometimes though, blood clots show up in other parts of the body. 
For example, clots can travel to the Brain and lodge in the blood vessels there, causing decreased blood flow to specific brain regions, known as a stroke.

⏩ Timestamps, click to skip ahead!
00:00 - Introduction
00:40 - 18 COVID Autopsies Study
07:30 - Why People Die for COVID

But this virus, in a different manner, can cause neurologic symptoms in some people, such as headache, confusion, and anosmia, meaning loss of taste and smell. But we don't really know why this covid sometimes causes these symptoms. Is it because the covid travels in the bloodstream to the Brain? Maybe. After all, there are ACE2 receptors that are located in the Brain. Is it because the virus got in our nose and used the olfactory nerves that are there to gain entry into our Brain? Or are these symptoms more related to the cytokine storm's effect, which is actually pretty familiar with infections in general, whether from pneumonia or something else? A recent study in NEJM looked at brain findings from autopsies done on 18 patients who died from COVID  in a single teaching hospital. All 18 patients had nasopharyngeal swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. 

11 COVID patients required mechanical ventilation, meaning a breathing tube. Interestingly, it was noted that all of the ventilated patients had a confusional state or decreased arousal from sedation for ventilation. I interpreted this because when they paused the sedation, meaning they temporarily stopped the sedation to assess their mental status, the patient could follow commands during that time. In general, this is not uncommon, but this does seem to occur more often with COVID patients, which I've been finding with my COVID patients in the ICU.

On average, these COVID patients died about 10 days after being admitted to the hospital. 
When they did the autopsies, they looked at the Brain as a whole, and they also sampled 10 different areas of the Brain and then looked at those samples underneath the microscope. Microscopic examination showed acute hypoxic injury in some regions of the Brain. Acute hypoxic injury means tissue was damaged due to not getting enough Oxygen. For example, an acute hypoxic injury in the cerebrum is the Brain's part that allows us to think and be conscious. There was also an acute hypoxic injury in the cerebellum in all the patients. There were no blood clots in the Brain or vasculitis, meaning inflammation of blood vessels. Another thing we want to know is, is the virus actually invading the cells of the Brain? This study actually tested the brain tissue for the virus with RT-PCR.

Check out this episode of our new Quibi show, Answered. 
There's a new episode daily you can watch here: https://link.quibi.com/answeredbyvoxyt

As coronavirus lockdowns loosen, flights are starting to fill up — leading many people to call for empty middle seats. Keeping middle seats open on a plane can help maintain physical distance between passengers. But it’s unlikely to prevent virus transmission; there are many other ways coronavirus can spread on an airplane. One thing’s for sure, though: a vacant middle seat will definitely affect how much we pay to fly.

As coronavirus continues to sweep around the globe, impacting billions of people’s lives physically, financially, and socially, teams around the globe are working tirelessly on finding sustainable and reliable vaccine solutions.

As of April 8th, there are 115 vaccine candidates in varying stages of research. Private companies like Moderna and Inovio are making headlines as they’re quickly progressing in the first stages of the vaccine approval process—a process that typically takes years is being pushed in a matter of months.

So how viable are any of these fast vaccines, and is it possible we will have a solution within the next year?

We spoke with Dr. Greg Poland, the Director at the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group, and Dr. Jerome Kim, the Director-General at the International Vaccine Institute to find out more about the potential timelines of these vaccines, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations or CEPI, and how vaccines work inside our bodies. Find out more in this Elements.

thxbiR-XfJo,2018-01-09,An Astronomer Responds To Flat Earth Theory,"Business Insider UK sat down with Dr Stuart Clark, who spoke to us about a range of subjects regarding astronomy and astrophysics. We asked him what he thought of flat earth theory, a school of thought which believes that the earth is not spherical but flat.

""All our physics is constructed now, the physics of orbits of things going around the earth is all constructed with this three dimensional world. And the pictures from space show our world as a globe and yet somehow there are some people that still seem to believe the earth is flat.""

""My own pet theory is that they’re doing it for comic effect.""

We just have to look at things in the sky with our eyeballs. In fact, that's how we figured out the earth is a sphere thousands of years ago, before science even existed. Last time we looked at the moon, so today let's look at the stars. How do they move through the sky, and can we make sense of it on a flat earth? Spoiler: no, we definitely can't. But be a lamb and watch anyway, would you?

_bHqBy92iGM,2020-04-24,Destroying Flat Earth Without Using Science - Part 1: The Moon,"My last flat earth video didn't sit too well with their ""community"", to say the least. My 10 challenges were apparently so impossible that no one attempted a single one of them, despite the numerous pathetic attempts at response videos. It has become clear that even though I've been explaining middle school level science in these videos, it's still way too far above their heads, so with this one I really wanted to break it down even further for them. Here's a tidy little morsel of flat earth destruction that requires precisely zero scientific knowledge to comprehend. Enjoy.

5 Ways To Prove You're A Car Guy - https://youtu.be/S9kMj02hhg4

When it comes to the earth being flat, humans of average intelligence often have what sound to be like very valid questions:
1. If the Earth is flat, why is the moon round?
2. If the Earth is flat, why do we have tides?
3. If the Earth is flat, why do we use globes?
4. If the Earth is flat, how do we explain space exploration? 
5. If the Earth is flat, why do we orbit around the sun?

These are all wonderful, painfully obvious questions, but as often occurs in nature, what's painfully obvious is painfully false. The Earth is flat, Bigfoot is real, and we never landed on the moon. And this video proves it.

What is the point of debate when one side the argument is objectively true? There is none.

That is, unless the incorrect arguer has the ability to influence the masses. When a relatively famous musician began spewing flat Earth views on social media, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson knew he had to jump in the ring and defend science with science.

General belief systems aren't a threat, but it's important to combat incorrect and dangerous views when they have a chance of pervading greater society.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
NEIL DEGRASSE:

Neil deGrasse Tyson was born and raised in New York City where he was educated in the public schools clear through his graduation from the Bronx High School of Science. Tyson went on to earn his BA in Physics from Harvard and his PhD in Astrophysics from Columbia. He is the first occupant of the Frederick P. Rose Directorship of the Hayden Planetarium. His professional research interests are broad, but include star formation, exploding stars, dwarf galaxies, and the structure of our Milky Way. Tyson obtains his data from the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as from telescopes in California, New Mexico, Arizona, and in the Andes Mountains of Chile.Tyson is the recipient of nine honorary doctorates and the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal. His contributions to the public appreciation of the cosmos have been recognized by the International Astronomical Union in their official naming of asteroid ""13123 Tyson"".

Tyson's new book is Letters From an Astrophysicist (2019).

TRANSCRIPT:  

I don’t like debating people because in a debate what is the construct. It’s typically two people and there’s an audience and you debate some opposite sides of some issue. And then there’s a winner of the debate. And then everyone walks away reflecting on the winner. So who wins the debate? It’s often the person who’s charismatic, who’s maybe charming – that’s related to charisma of course. Who has a good way with words, good vocabulary. And you can have someone who doesn’t have any of that who is speaking objective truths who could lose a debate. So then what is the point of the debate of one of these points of view is objectively true. So I will not enter a debate where I have the objectively true side of an argument and the other person does not. That is something that should not be debated, does not belong in front of an audience getting debated. You want to debate something? Debate political policy of what to do in the face of climate change.

Do you have carbon tax? Do you have solar panels? Do you subsidize them? Debate that. Don’t debate something that is or is not objectively true in this world. The B.o.B, the rapper, I have a video letter to him the transcript of which is in Letters from an Astrophysicist. That rose to that level of attention because he started saying I am using laws of math and physics to show Earth is flat. Those are fighting words. If you’re going to say using math and physics, that is an alarm to the geekiverse that we must rise up and counteract these forces from the dark side that are out there. So, the bat signal went up. I responded. What is the bat signal? Oh, sorry. In my Twitter stream there are people saying Neil, you’ve got to do something about B.o.B. Save him from himself. He’s saying Earth is flat. Then I first said who’s B.o.B? So I quickly looked him up. Oh, he’s a rap star. Okay.

These are people who follow me and B.o.B in the Twitterverse. So what does that Venn diagram look like. How much overlap is there in the two Venn diagrams. In this slice, however narrow, they were pleading to me to do something and so I responded with a video letter. Just kind of putting him in his place.

I think it’s important to combat people who are claiming that they are using math, science, evidence and physics behind their cause when, in fact, they either aren’t or they’re using it badly. That needs to be called out. Otherwise if you just have a belief system I don’t really care. We live in a country that protects free speech which usually also means free thought. If you want to think Earth is flat, go right ahead. But if you start influencing other people who have power over other people and you have no foundation and objective reality it can be dangerous. If you influence people or you yourself become someone who has influence over legislation, laws, rules by which we all abide in society. That’s an unhealthy situation for civilization to be in. If your personal belief system...

Hey flat Earthers, it's time to put your theory to bed once and for all! ""There are so many proofs that the Earth is round, it's difficult to know where to start. And it's not okay to think that the Earth is flat; this is not a viable argument,"" says NASA astronomer Michelle Thaller.Thaller explains three observable proofs that instantly debunk flat-Earth theory with irrefutable evidence of the Earth's round, curvaceous, gloriously spherical shape.The ancient Greeks figured out we were living on a sphere over 2,000 years ago, and there are things you can do to prove that the Earth is indeed round—just go to a body of water and look at ships or boats on the horizon with binoculars. Watch the video for the details!You can follow Michelle Thaller on Twitter at @mlthaller.

MICHELLE THALLER:

Dr. Michelle Thaller is an astronomer who studies binary stars and the life cycles of stars. She is Assistant Director of Science Communication at NASA. She went to college at Harvard University, completed a post-doctoral research fellowship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, Calif. then started working for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Spitzer Space Telescope. After a hugely successful mission, she moved on to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), in the Washington D.C. area. In her off-hours often puts on about 30lbs of Elizabethan garb and performs intricate Renaissance dances. For more information, visit

TRANSCRIPT:

MICHELLE THALLER: So, Oscar, you asked the question, ""What are some of the easiest ways that you can prove that the Earth is round?"" Because apparently, this is something that we're debating—I have no idea why.

That's a hard thing for me to even start talking about because there are so many proofs that the Earth is round, it's difficult to know where to start. And it's not okay to think that the Earth is flat. This is not a viable argument.

I have friends who have been on the International Space Station, they have orbited the Earth once every 90 minutes; I've had personal experience with people who have been up in space and can see with their own eyes that the Earth is round. And of course, we've taken all of these amazing pictures from space; they're so beautiful, all those pictures of the Earth.

So I don't really know what's going on right now with this 'Earth is flat' thing, but I will tell you that this is one of the things I really enjoyed teaching my own astronomy class about because there are proofs all around you. It is not difficult to know that the Earth is round. In fact, people have known of this for way more than 2,000 years. The ancient Greeks actually had a number of really elegant, wonderful proofs that the earth was a sphere. 

So let's start from the simple to the slightly more complicated. One of the things you can see yourself, with a pair of binoculars, is if you actually go out to a lake and there are boats on that lake, the farther away a boat is the more the bottom of the boat will disappear, and you'll basically just see the mast of the boat. And as a boat goes farther and farther away the last thing you will see is the very top of the mast of that boat, and that's because the boat is actually going over the horizon that's curved—and that means that as it goes farther and farther away you see less and less of the bottom of it, and more of the top of that. You can see that with binoculars by an ocean, by a lake, it's really easy. That wouldn't happen if the Earth were flat—you would simply see the boat getting smaller and smaller and smaller as it went farther away, but you'd be able to see the whole thing with the same proportions.

Now, another way that you can tell that we're on a sphere is to think about how there's something called the tropics on the Earth, and the tropics are places near the equator of the earth were sometimes the sun is overhead in the sky. This was actually something that the Greeks used, not only to prove that the Earth was round about 2000 years ago, but they actually measured the circumference of the Earth, accurate to within just a couple percent. 2,000 years ago we've known that the Earth was round.

There was a really brilliant Greek scientist called Eratosthenes, and Eratosthenes noticed that there was a town called Syene, and on a certain date the sun would actually shine straight down to the bottom of a well. That mea...

If you see animals when you look at clouds or see faces in pieces of wood, that's called pareidolia: the phenomenon of making familiar objects from vague stimuli.

Humans evolved to be superstitious, and Michio Kaku posits that there is a gene for superstition and magical thinking. Nine times out of 10, your beliefs can be wrong, but one time out of 10 it saved your ancestors' butts, says Kaku.

Flat Earthers and anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists exist now, and they will still exist in 1,000 years, says Kaku. It's natural. Humans evolved to believe in nonsense, but it's by becoming good at something totally unnatural to us – science – that reason can prevail.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MICHIO KAKU

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

MICHIO KAKU: We still have Flat Earthers, we have people that don't believe in vaccinations, and what do we do about it? Well, first of all, I think there's a gene. I think there's a gene for superstition, a gene for hearsay, a gene for magic, a gene for magical thinking. And I think that, when we were in the forest, that gene actually helped us. Because 9 times out of 10, that gene was wrong. Superstition didn't work. But 1 time out of 10, it saved your butt. That's why the gene is still here, the gene for superstition and magic. 

Now, there's no gene for science. Science is based on things that are reproducible, testable -- it's a long process, the scientific method. It's not part of our natural thinking. It's an acquired taste, just like broccoli. You have to learn how the power can be unleashed by looking at your diet, for example. So I think 1,000 years from now, 1,000 years from now, we will have Flat Earthers. A thousand years from now, we will have people that still do not want to be vaccinated. OK? So what do we do about it? 

Well, it's a struggle. It's a struggle that's eternal, because I think it's part of our genetic makeup. And there's even a name for some of this superstition. It's called pareidolia. What is pareidolia? It's the idea that when you look in the sky, you see things that are not there. Here's one experiment: Look at the clouds and try not to see something there. It's very difficult. You look at the clouds. You can't help it. You see Donald Duck. You see Mickey Mouse. You see snakes, animals. You see all sorts of stuff. You can't help it. Recently, the Notre Dame Cathedral partially burned down. And sure enough, somebody said, 'I see Jesus Christ there.' I saw the picture. Maybe you did, too. It really did look like Jesus Christ. But it was the ashes of Notre Dame. And how many times do people see the Virgin Mary in a glass of tea? So we are hardwired to see things that are not there. Because for the most part, they're harmless. For the most part, they do nothing. And once in a while, it saves our butt. 

And so that's why I think we will have Flat Earthers, we will have the people who don't like vaccination, because hearsay throughout human history was the dominant form of information-sharing. You know, the internet is very new. Newspapers are very new. Science and technology is very new. But gossip, hearsay, slander, rumors, there's a gene for that. OK? So how do you combat it? Slowly, carefully, painfully -- it's a painful process, but in some sense, we're going up against our genetic predisposition to believe in nonsense.

To the average person, there appears to be a growing number of people who believe — somehow — that the world is actually flat and that we are all being ""lied"" to by world governments. Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield has actually been to space and has seen that the world is round, but is unphased by these so-called ""flat-earthers."" He flatly (pun intended) denies a global conspiracy, and says that perhaps the best way to deal with such willful ignorance is just to ignore it. After all, he posits, ""if you wrestle with a pig, the best you can be is a pig wrestler."" It's folky wisdom like that which puts Chris into another stratosphere of intelligence. Chris Hadfield is the author of An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHRIS HADFIELD:

“Good morning, Earth.” That is how Colonel Chris Hadfield—writing on Twitter—woke up the world every day while living aboard the International Space Station for over five months. Since blasting off from Kazakhstan in December 2012, Hadfield has become a worldwide sensation, harnessing the power of social media to make outer space accessible to millions and infusing a sense of wonder into the collective consciousness not felt since man first walked on the moon. Called “the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong” by the BBC, Hadfield, now safely back on Earth, continues to bring the glory of science and space travel to everyone he encounters.

Hadfield is the pioneer of many firsts. In 1992, he was selected by the Canadian Space Agency as a NASA Mission Specialist – Canada’s first fully-qualified Space Shuttle crewmember. Three years later, he was the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in space, and the first Canadian to board a Russian spacecraft as he helped build the Russian space station ‘Mir’. In 2001, he performed two spacewalks - the first Canadian to do so - and in 2010 the CSA and NASA announced Hadfield’s third mission: commanding the International Space Station (ISS)—again a first for a Canadian.

Hadfield launched into space on December 19, 2012 and took command of the ISS in March. His multiple daily Tweets and photographs from space made people see the world differently. His accessibility, whether answering questions such as, “How do you wring out a washcloth in space,” via Skype or collaborating with The Barenaked Ladies for a song sung by nearly a million people simultaneously, endeared him to all while he orbited Earth. 

A heavily decorated astronaut, engineer, and pilot, Hadfield’s many awards include receiving the Order of Ontario, the Meritorious Service Cross, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He was named the top Test Pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and has been inducted into Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame. He is also commemorated on Canadian postage stamps, Royal Canadian Mint silver and gold coins, and on Canada’s new 5 dollar bill.

TRANSCRIPT:

Chris Hadfield: When the very first balloon was launched that could carry people it was in Paris in the late 1700s and it was Montgolfier the brothers, they had hydrogen balloons and hot air balloons and it was the cutting edge of science. It was the cutting edge of technology. We just learned how to capture a gas like hydrogen that would be lighter than air as you could take a balloon and the first balloon rose and Ben Franklin was there and it was huge and magnificent, all of those scientists. And it rose but it got out of control and it went and landed out in the countryside 15 miles away from Paris and the peasants there attacked it with pitchforks because they thought it was an alien coming from space. The schism between learned understanding and scientific pursuit and the common perception of what was normal was that close just 15 miles away. It was an enormous gap between what we knew and what we were doing and what a lot of folks knew yet or what had become part of common knowledge. So there's nothing new about the speed with which we're inventing things and the ability for people to understand what's going on. There's a recent populous sort of wave of anti-science as if that's something new. It's mostly because social media has given everybody what appears to be an equal voice. On the corner of Hyde Park in London there's Speakers Corner and that used to be the Internet where yo...

gNtaaaFKssU,2019-06-07,Professor Dave Debates Podcast #6 - Is the Earth Flat?,"Way, way, before I made any of my flat earth content on YouTube, I did a podcast episode about this. It sparked my interest, so I came back to it later! Here is the original description:

You've seen it in your Facebook feed. People all around the globe believe there is no globe, but rather that our world is flat like a pancake! NASA is lying, the government is lying, airline pilots and stewardesses, they're all in it, and we're the chumps. To be fair, can you prove that the Earth is round? If you can't, you'd better listen to this episode and make sure. We hit all the major talking points for you. Billy Hubbard is a physicist, so he should know. Unless he's part of the conspiracy. Moderator David Huntsberger also has some ideas. But comedians might be in on it too. Who can you trust? Make up your own mind!

Guest: Billy Hubbard
Moderator: David Huntsberger

ZMtx5jVLUaU,2019-11-03,Why Flat Earth failed,"Dear World,

It seems making debunking videos has also made it on my schedule now...
I remember the times where the comment section was actually filled with questions or rational discussions at times.
Now videos that show the peaks of scientific results often earn hatred.

Mostly people are attacking the concept of science in an attempt to feel special.
The paradox is that they are attacking exactly the thing that makes us special.

Because science is what makes us really different from the other life here on the planet. 
Knowing about reality gives us the power to modify our environment or create things.
Right now you are looking at a computer screen, something that our ancestors could not have dreamed of.

We live in a time of abundant information. And exactly that fact makes it difficult to deal with information. 
But I am sure most people still appreciate science and how it opens our eyes for the wonders of reality.

I saw that Ryan Higa ( NigaHiga ) made a satirical video about the flat earth conspiracy theory and I decided to look into it. My first Idea was to make a video of me reacting to some of the conspiracists videos but that didn't go great, it was just me looking at the screen upset. So, ranting time.

Would we still have time zones? Change of seasons? Would the conditions for life here on Earth exist at all? Most early theories on the shape of the Earth were based on religious interpretations. But what about modern-day believers in a non-round Earth?

Instead of doing that, let’s use science to understand why this is happening in the first place.

In US news and current events today, anti-vaxxers descended on the New Jersey Senate to try to stop a bill that makes it harder to avoid vaccinations. 

Under NJ A3818, parents could apply for a vaccine exemption but only with a letter signed by a doctor. Stating why the vaccination is ‘medically contraindicated.’ 

The bill also states that exemptions will not be considered for ‘a general philosophical or moral objection.’

Currently the state, New Jersey. If you go to your school nurse and tell them that because their religion, you don't want vaccines, that's a blank check for no vaccines.

Exemptions would also not be considered if someone has a ‘political, sociological or moral’ objection or ‘concerns related to the safety or efficacy of the vaccination.’

Under the bill, students could be excluded from school ‘In the event of the occurence of a communicable disease.’

Watch the full story on anti-vaxxers protesting the vaccination bill here.

In US news and current events today, an anti-vaxxer was arrested for refusing to leave a playground spurring far-right protests in Idaho. 40-year-old Sara Walton Brady was arrested on April 21 after refusing requests from police to leave a closed-down playground. Walton Brady, along with a group of parents, removed metal signage and caution tape  indicating that the playground was closed due to COVID-19. The 40-year-old is a noted anti-vaxxer and critic of the state’s  vaccination rules. She runs a Facebook group called Idahoans for Vaccine Freedom. Walton Brady’s arrest galvanized far-right groups in the state, leading to same-day protests at the arresting police officer’s home, as well as outside of Meridian City Hall. Walton Brady was released later on April 21 after posting a cash bond.

qRrAPKOhHL0,2019-04-26,How Trump & Republicans Keep Spreading Misinformation About Vaccines | NowThis,"The U.S. is experiencing its largest measles outbreak since 2000 — and these Republicans keep spreading misinformation about life-saving vaccines.
» Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_Subscribe

Vaccines and vaccination have the power to save lives, but President Trump and his fellow Republicans continue to spread misinformation about measles, autism, vaccine science, and more.

Several current GOP officeholders have said really dumb things about vaccination. Donald Trump has echoed the conspiracy theory 
 that vaccines cause autism.

TRUMP: And we’ve had so many instances, people that work for me just the other day, 2 years old, two and a half years old, the child the beautiful child, went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very very sick, now he’s autistic. 

North Carolina rep. Mark Green echoed the same debunked claim.

GREEN: There is some concern that the rise in autism is a result of the preservatives in our vaccines. 

Green, once Trump’s nominee for Army Secretary,  has also argued against climate science, LGBTQ rights, and evolution. TX state rep. Bill Zedler said measles won’t cause deaths in the U.S.

“They want to say people are dying of measles. Yeah, in third-world countries they’re dying of measles,” Zedler said, shaking his head. “Today, with antibiotics and that kind of stuff, they’re not dying in America.” - Texas Observer

Measles is a virus. Antibiotics treat bacterial infections. There is no treatment for measles.  Zedler went on to say “This is not the Soviet Union, you know.”

Arizona state rep. Kelly Townsend also linked vaccination to communism. OK Governor Kevin Stitt made this statement on vaccination.

STITT: So under vaccines, you know I believe in choice. And we’ve got six children, and we don’t vaccinate, we don’t  do vaccinations on all of our children.

Then walked it back.

STITT: What I’m learning in politics is your opponents will try to twist things around. But the fact is I vaccinated all six of my children. What I said was, vaccinations are between a parent and their pediatrician.

There are anti-vaccine proponents on the left as well, notably Jill Stein and Robert Kennedy Jr., neither of whom hold elected office.

Read more here:  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/16/world-health-organization-says-measles-cases-up-percent/?utm_term=.618f4688a066

""Measles cases increased 300 percent worldwide in the first three months of 2019 compared to the first three months in 2018, according to the World Health Organization.

The 2019 increase ""follows consecutive increases over the past two years,” according to a World Health Organization statement, which added, “While this data is provisional and not yet complete, it indicates a clear trend. Many countries are in the midst of sizeable measles outbreaks, with all regions of the world experiencing sustained rises in cases.”

Measles is preventable by vaccine — but vaccination rates are declining. In part, that’s due to supply problems. In Madagascar, for example, infrastructure provided a challenge, contributing to a measles outbreak earlier this year. Africa had the biggest rise in measles cases — 700 percent compared to the same period in 2018.""

T9Zn0SUbSSI,2017-06-28,Anti-Vaxxers And Fear Caused Minnesota's Measles Outbreak (HBO),"Abdinasir Fidow, a Somali father of seven living in Minneapolis, had heard of the measles outbreak spreading in his state, the worst flare-up in Minnesota in three decades. But even fear of the potentially deadly virus wasn’t enough to motivate Fidow to inoculate five of his children with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. “I’m not willing to do that, because I’m scared for the MMR,” Fidow said. “I don’t want to lose another kid again.”

Fidow’s eldest son, Abdullahi, 14, did get the vaccine, over a decade ago. A few months later, Fidow said, Abdullahi was diagnosed with autism and severe intellectual disabilities. Despite all scientific evidence to the contrary, Fidow believes that his son’s diagnosis is directly linked to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine — a belief shared by Somali parents he knows.

For many in the Somali community, autism is an American-born condition. Those in the neighborhoods around the “Somali Mall” in Minneapolis, a city that houses the largest Somali population in the country, hadn’t even heard the word “autism” before coming to the U.S. from Somalia, where the measles vaccine is also less common. Yet for almost a decade, fewer and fewer Somali children in Minnesota are inoculated because of their parents’ fears, propelled by bad science and anti-vaxxer efforts, of autism diagnoses. Now, Minnesota has seen more measles cases just since April than the entire U.S. in all of 2016. And 84 percent of those cases have occurred in the Somali community, mostly in children.

fxehTVbA-aI,2020-07-24,Boris Johnson calls anti-vaxxers ‘nuts’ and says we'll be past coronavirus by mid-2021,"Coronavirus latest - Boris Johnson has today blasted anti-vaxxers as ""nuts"" and urged everyone to get the flu vaccine this summer.

Adding, coronavirus will be with Britain until the ""middle of next year"" the Prime Minister has admitted.

The PM lashed out at those who don't get their jabs as the Government launched a huge new drive to try and protect the NHS this winter ahead of a possible second coronavirus wave.

Speaking to Sky News on a visit to a GP centre today, he said:

There's all these anti-vaxxers now.

""They are nuts, they are nuts.""

The Government is aiming to double its winter flu vaccination programme in England - with free shots for those aged 50 and over and 11-year-olds.

Last year, around 15 million people received a jab against seasonal flu but ministers hope this will rise to 30 million this winter.

Experts are concerned about the impact of a double whammy of Covid-19 cases and seasonal flu potentially overwhelming the NHS.

There are also worries that people could suffer both seasonal flu and Covid-19 at the same time.

He said today: ""We want everybody to get a flu jab in the run-up to this winter and that's why we're rolling out the biggest-ever programme of flu immunisation.

""And we're aiming first of all for schoolchildren up to year 7, for pregnant women, for people over 65, for people who are shielded, but then we will be extending it to people who are 50 to 65.

""Now the reason for doing this is to protect the NHS in the winter months because obviously we have still got Covid, we have still got the threat of a second spike on Covid, and it's vital therefore to keep that pressure off the NHS by everybody getting a flu jab and I really hope everybody will.""

The Prime Minister said getting a flu jab is something that can help to ""protect the NHS"".

He told Sky News: ""I just urge everybody in those groups to do it.

""It is something you can do to protect yourself against flu but it's also something that we can all do to protect the NHS.""

Speaking on the first anniversary of becoming PM today, he said he believes that by the ""middle of next year"" Britain will be ""well on the way past"" COVID-19.

He previously had said he hoped by Christmas things would be almost back to normal.

He said: ""But I must be clear with people, I do still think that we have tough times ahead in keeping this virus under control,"" he said.

""We have tough times ahead in coming through economically.""

The PM refused to say when social distancing guidelines would be able to stop.

He added: ""The use of face masks, the use of all the social distancing measures really does depend on our ability collectively to get the pandemic right down and to keep it down.

""I'm not going to make a prediction about when these various social distancing measures will come off.""

Boris Johnson was asked about whether he thinks it is a good idea for the public to be ""shaming"" people who are not wearing masks in places where they should be wearing them.

He replied: ""I think we should rely on the massive common sense of the British people that have so far delivered the results that we've seen, and that's going to work.""

Jimmy believes strongly in vaccination - but in the interest of fairness, we gave our community activist team Jack and Becky some air time to express their anti-vaccination views.

TsUb-sialn8,2019-11-25,Dr. Anthony Fauci: The anti-vaxx movement is 'libertarianism taken to the extreme',"Long-time head of the infectious disease institute at NIH, Dr. Anthony Fauci denounces the anti-vaccine movement that has led to upticks in cases of illnesses like measles. He tells Ian Bremmer that not only are most beliefs about the perceived dangers of vaccines misguided and inaccurate, they put large swaths of communities at risk.

The “Spanish flu” virus of 1918 killed an estimated 50 million people, more than all the deaths in World War I combined. While global public health efforts have greatly improved mortality rates in more modern outbreaks, experts say the next pandemic is a matter of “when,” not “if.” In this episode, Ian Bremmer takes a look how diseases spread and become global. His guest, Dr. Anthony Fauci, is a leading epidemiologist and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH.
 
Dr. Fauci breaks down some of the biggest health threats facing the world today: HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria, tuberculosis, influenza, and the recent rise in cases of measles brought on by the misguided anti-vaccine movement.
 
Also on the show: Five years after his Ebola diagnosis made international news, NYC’s Dr. Craig Spencer tells GZERO Media what he learned from the experience and what his life is like today.

zyZ7u8GRF70,2019-03-05,Why are there still anti-vaxxers? | Al Jazeera English,"A study of more than half a million children in Denmark shows there is no link between autism and the MMR vaccine, which is used to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. Yet people continue to resist vaccinations.

Tens of thousands of people die every year from measles, a disease that can be prevented with a simple vaccine.  

Al Jazeera's Mereana Hond looks at why, against all scientific proof, scepticism over vaccines persists.

UduDFe5I4CI,2019-03-29,How the anti-vax movement brought the measles back from near extinction,"Measles, mumps and rubella: Why are we starting to see the return of these diseases in the U.S.? It begins with the anti-vax movement.

A measles outbreak in Rockland County, New York, has forced officials to declare a state of emergency in the sixth and largest outbreak across the United States this year, according to the CDC. 

The New York County has identified 157 measles cases since October, causing health officials to ban anyone under 18 and not vaccinated against measles from public places. The ban will last for 30 days or until the entire community is vaccinated.

In a first-of-its kind experiment, researchers at Washington State University have shown that people tend to be persuaded less by credible pro- and anti-vaccination information published online than by individual users who hang around in comments threads on the topic kicking up dust.

The findings, which will appear in an upcoming Journal of Advertising, underscore the powerful influence of information disseminated by word of mouth. Moreover, they offer a striking insight into the ability of the anti-vaccination movement to flourish despite mounting outrage and overwhelming scientific evidence that supports vaccination.""

prkWwLOWoXY,2017-08-06,Rabid Anti-Vaxxers Literally Spreading Rabies,"Hope you like rabies! Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasparian, the hosts of The Young Turks, tell you how the anti-vaccine movement is worried about autism in dogs. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. https://tytnetwork.com/join/

“Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence proving that vaccines are beneficial to all of humanity, an alarming number of people still believe that deeply researched and tested medicine is harmful and not to be trusted. In addition to arguing that people should fear vaccines because of scary chemicals and toxins, some truly believe that shots will give their children autism.

While I 100% advocate for parents doing their research and consulting their doctors about their child's allergies and specific medical conditions, for the life of me I cannot understand why measles outbreaks aren't enough to convince people that vaccines play a critical role in keeping our communities safe. Also in making sure that we don't all die from the next deadly plague.”

f6FUJp5nRmU,2020-07-29,UK PM: 'all these anti-vaxxers...they are nuts',"(24 Jul 2020) British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a widespread flu vaccination programme was a priority in the run up to winter, to insulate the public health system from the pressures of COVID-19 and a possible spike in infections during the colder months.
""We've still got the threat of a second spike of COVID and it's vital, therefore, to keep that pressure off the NHS (UK National Health Service) by everybody getting a flu jab,"" Johnson said during a visit to a medical practice in east London.
In conversation with nurses on immunization programmes, Johnson criticized people who don't vaccinate their children against childhood illnesses.
""There are all these anti-vaxxers now, they are nuts,"" he was overheard telling practice staff.
From the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine skeptics have tailored several long-standing claims about vaccine safety to fit the current outbreak. 
Health experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence the coronavirus was intentionally created or spread. 
They also insist that vaccines are not only safe, but essential to global health.
The United Nations warned last week about an alarming decline in childhood vaccinations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that the likelihood a child born today will have all recommended vaccines by the age of five is less than 20%.
Johnson was visiting the east London practice as new rules on wearing masks in England came into force, with people going to shops, banks and supermarkets now required to wear face coverings.
Police can hand out fines of 100 pounds (127 US dollars) if people refuse, but authorities are hoping that peer pressure will prompt compliance.
The move had been controversial, with the government offering mixed signals on the matter for weeks before coming up with a policy.
Johnson said using masks and social distancing were important factors in keeping the pandemic under control. 
On Friday said he believed that by the middle of next year, ""we'll be well on the way past it (COVID-19),"" but he cautioned there were still ""tough times ahead in keeping this virus under control and we have tough times ahead in coming through economically.""
Johnson's visit came on the first anniversary of his becoming leader of the Conservative party.

zR5-Fpx6wtM,2019-04-29,Anti-vaccine families crowd California Capitol,"(25 Apr 2019) Hundreds of critics of mandatory vaccines were in Sacramento Wednesday opposing a California proposal to give state public health officials instead of local doctors the power to decide which children can skip their shots before attending school.
They packed the first legislative hearing on a bill that proponents said would stem bogus exemptions granted in many cases by doctors who are paid to excuse students from vaccinations.
Democratic Sen. Richard Pan of Sacramento said his legislation would give state health officials the tools they need to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, which in the first four months of the year have reached 28 confirmed cases in California.
An Associated Press count shows this year's national measles tally is the highest since 1994.
""If we continue to let these fake medical exemptions increase, we're going to have another larger outbreak, and we need to stop that now,"" Pan said.
Pan's bill is one of a number of efforts by state legislatures to address measles outbreaks. Washington state lawmakers voted Tuesday to remove parents' ability to claim a personal or philosophical exemption from vaccinating their children for measles, although medical and religious exemptions will remain. Oregon is considering removing all non-medical exemptions, drawing the ire of hundreds of parents who came to the state capitol Tuesday to protest.
Opponents of Pan's bill, including members of parental rights and religious groups, doctors and alternative healthcare practitioners, said the measure strips away parents' rights and isn't necessary to prevent outbreaks.
Del Bigtree, of the Informed Consent Action Network, produced the documentary VAXXED. 
""I think it's pretty obvious that this bill gets in the way of the doctor-patient relationship,"" he said. ""I think that that's a dangerous step for medicine in general.""
Dr. Sergio Flores, testifying in support of the bill on behalf of the California Medical Association, countered that ""vaccines save lives."" Dozens of other medical professionals and students, many wearing white medical jackets, also lined up to support the bill.
Sacramento mother Alyssa Hernandez supported the bill, saying a high vaccination rate is necessary to protect her two-year-old Noah. He received a liver transplant and so cannot be vaccinated himself against many common but vaccination-preventable diseases. ""Each of them could be life-threatening for him,"" she said.
Critics are unlikely to derail the bill because Pan, a Sacramento pediatrician, is chairman of the Senate Health Committee considering his legislation.

Pourtant, le retour de certaines maladies, comme la rougeole, inquiète les autorités sanitaires. Des centaines de cas, dont trois mortels, ont été recensés en France depuis le début de l'année.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Measles is back in the United States, and to understand why, you have to understand where.

When anti-vaccination misinformation leads to a drop in the number of children immunized, a community can lose its “herd immunity.” This happens most often in small, tight-knit communities, in which measles can spread like wildfire. 75% of all recent measles cases have happened in those types of communities.

In order for everyone to be protected from measles, all people who can get vaccinated need to. But most states allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children for any philosophical reason - and that’s allowing measles to make a comeback.

Officials in anti-vaccination ‘hotspot’ near Portland declare an emergency over measles outbreak

A quickly escalating measles outbreak around Portland, Ore., has led health officials in nearby Clark County, Wash., to declare a public health emergency as they warn that people infected with the highly contagious virus have visited schools and churches, a dentist’s office, a Costco, an Ikea and an Amazon locker pickup station.

Someone with measles was at Concourse D of the Portland International Airport on Jan. 7, the county’s public health department advised. An infected person attended a Portland Trail Blazers home game Jan. 11.

At the beginning of last week, there were only a handful of confirmed cases. On Friday, the day the emergency was declared, there were 19. By Sunday, that number had grown to 21. The latest update came Tuesday, when county officials said they had confirmed 23 cases and were investigating two more suspected cases. The vast majority of those who have fallen ill had not been immunized.

HrUYKKaUDHo,2019-04-04,This County Banned Unvaccinated Kids From Public Spaces (HBO),"Joe Hendrick’s sons are part of a growing number of children in the US who have not been vaccinated. Their family has decided against vaccines for reasons that mix a firm belief in personal freedom with scientifically-unconfirmed concerns about what’s inside vaccines. But unlike most unvaccinated families, Joe’s family is facing a first-of-its-kind ultimatum: get your kids vaccinated or keep the out of all public places.

Last week, Rockland County, New York instituted a thirty day ban on unvaccinated children in public spaces, including schools. The county declared a state of emergency after six months of uncooperative people hanging up the phone, closing the door on inspectors, and refusing to report cases.

Dr. Patricia Ruppert, the Rockland County Health Commissioner, says there have been 161 confirmed cases of measles and that there are likely many more that they don’t know about. While 98% of the cases to date have been among Orthodox Jewish residents who live in tight-knit enclaves, the health department is fighting to communicate to the county that every single unvaccinated person, regardless of faith, bears responsibility for potential spread.

In the interim, Joe Hendrick has chosen homeschooling over vaccination. He's now juggling that with his job and a two-week old newborn child. When asked if having a new baby had given him any second thoughts, Joe explained that he felt emboldened. ""I'd rather move and make sure my family is safe and, you know, we have the right to choose for ourselves instead of being forced into something that could potentially hurt my child.""

VICE News traveled to Rockland County, where officials are trying to reach people who have put personal choice over public health.

YMW4eyY2FVM,2020-08-11,Anti-mask rant in Arizona store caught on video gets out of hand | New York Post,"Viral video captures an anti-mask tirade that got so out of hand, the ranter’s son had to pick him up and haul him out of an Arizona store.
“You’re a bunch of idiots wearing masks, you know it’s not real,” the unidentified man is seen jawing inside the Sprouts Farmer’s Market in Tucson.

“Look at you fools. You got a f—ng doily on your face, retard. Looks like you f—ng got it off your mom’s countertop,” he screams. “I’ll beat that f—ng mask off your face. F—ng p—-ies. You’re all a bunch of p—-ies wearing masks.”
The undated video shows the man, wearing shorts, a blue t-shirt, and a white cap, in mid-tirade inside the store with three younger men around him — including one identified by TMZ as his son.

None of them are wearing masks.

As things get more heated two of the younger men stand in his way during a loud exchange with others in the store.

Finally, the man identified as his son then picks him up and literally carries him outside, where he is seen knocking over a stack of boxes on his way out.
“Come outside. Come outside and show me how tough you are,” he yells as he’s being hauled away. “I’ll beat that f—ng mask off your face.”
As he leaves a woman’s voice is heard saying only, “Goodbye.”

offPZ26SObs,2020-07-12,Coronavirus: Anti-mask activists rally in U.S. virus epicentre Florida,"Anti-mask activists on July 11 took their campaign to a grilled cheese bar and restaurant in Windermere, Fla., a state fast becoming the epicentre of COVID-19 in the United States. 

The grilled cheese bar, 33 & Melt, has become a focal point of tension after its owner said it was not demanding face masks in her establishment.

In response, the activists organised the gathering, with a promise of 100 free meals for patrons who come without any masks.

The rally became tense when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents arrived at the restaurant and served the owner with a warning.

President Donald Trump, who has avoided wearing a mask in public even as the coronavirus pandemic spread, donned one on Saturday at a military medical facility outside Washington where he was to meet with wounded soldiers and front-line health-care workers.

Top public health officials have urged the use of masks to slow the spread of the virus. Critics say Trump's refusal to wear one showed a lack of leadership.

Florida has emerged as an epicenter of COVID-19 infections in the country. Over the past two weeks, the state reported 109,000 new coronavirus cases, more than any other U.S. state.

The number of confirmed U.S. infections is over 3 million, according to a Reuters tally, stoking fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed. Nearly 134,000 Americans have died, a toll that experts warn will likely surge along with the rise in cases.

Overall, coronavirus cases are rising in 44 American states, based on a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.

One man wore a plague doctor costume, another had a mask with the front ripped out and one donned a vest saying: 'Save human rights. No to 5G. No to vaccinations.' The protest was organised to counter the government announcement that masks must be worn in shops from July 24. The rally echos similar scenes in the US, where anti-mask activists gathered outside the statehouse in Ohio yesterday. It comes as the UK government toughened its stance on the wearing of face coverings in public places. Passengers have to use them on public transport and they will be made compulsory in shops and supermarkets in England from July 24. Rule breakers will be hit with a £100 which can be reduced to £50 if paid within a fortnight.

In US news and current events today, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage and COVID 19 cases continue to spread throughout the country, anti mask protests are still occurring in even the hardest hit states. Many an anti mask Karen has taken to the streets in anti mask rally and anti mask protest around the state, and as this mask protest Florida video illustrates, they're not very persuasive in their arguments. The anti mask Florida protests and anti mask Karens are a symptom of COVID19 becoming tragically politicized, as most scientists agree we could get the disease under control if we just wore masks. Unfortunately, the antimask movement continues to grow, aided by the extremely unhelpful President Trump administration.

Eric Quinitar from The Daily Wire reports, During a CBS News appearance on Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams defended remarks he made on the show back in March when he was still cautioning people to not wear face masks because, when it comes to getting infected with coronavirus, they “do not work for the general public.”

Some demonstrators marched under the banner ""Celebration of freedom and peace"".

Counter-demonstrators staged rival protests. 

“I think it’s so selfish,” Nada, a counter-demonstrator originally from Iran, said. “Actually, these rules are necessary at this period of time. Otherwise, this virus can spread so easily.”

The protest ended peacefully, with eyewitnesses estimating the number of attendees at about two thousand.

Man-made climate change is warming the planet's atmosphere and oceans, and the effects are being felt the most at the poles. In Antarctica, home to the largest chunk of ice on earth, ice shelves and glaciers are beginning to collapse, and one in particular could spell disaster. The Thwaites Glacier, in West Antarctica, has retreated more than 14 kilometers in the last two decades as warm ocean water undermines it. The glacier is situated on a downward slope that falls deep into the center of Antarctica. It's why scientists are racing to find out how close it is to total collapse - and what that would mean for future sea levels.

Consider the following scenario: a highly infectious, sometimes deadly respiratory virus infects humans for the first time. It spreads rapidly worldwide, and the WHO declares a pandemic. The death toll starts to rise and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? Alex Rosenthal details the three main strategies governments can use to contain and end a pandemic.

Russia is hoping to start mass production of the Corona vaccine soon, President Putin said. Meanwhile, Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said that the first Russian vaccine against Coronavirus would begin to be produced at two sites - Gamaleya Research Institute and the Binnopharm company.

रूस जल्द ही कोरोना वैक्सीन के बड़े पैमाने पर उत्पादन शुरू करने की उम्मीद कर रहा है, राष्ट्रपति पुतीन ने कहा। इस बीच, रूसी स्वास्थ्य मंत्री मिखाइल मुराशको ने कहा कि कोरोनोवायरस के खिलाफ पहला रूसी वैक्सीन का उत्पादन दो साइटों - गमलेया शोध संस्थान और बिन्नोफार्म कंपनी में जल्द शुरू हो जाएगा।

KrfcglOmBYw,2015-01-12,Zombie Starfish | Nature's Weirdest Events - BBC,"Subscribe and 🔔 to the BBC 👉 https://bit.ly/BBCYouTubeSub
Watch the BBC first on iPlayer 👉 https://bbc.in/iPlayer-Home Once again Nature's Weirdest Events has trawled the internet, raided their contact book and scoured the scientific world to unearth a treasure trove of bizarre and baffling stories. Using UGC clips of the events themselves, Chris Packham deconstructs the weirdness using eyewitness accounts, scientists and BBC archive footage.

In this series there is everything from scores of pigs swimming in the Caribbean to the tiny tick that is turning America vegetarian. There is a giant worm decimating fish tanks, a strange blob appearing when comets are seen, the real-life sea serpent washed up on the Californian coast and a Japanese island swarming with rabbits.

In the UK a virgin snake gives birth, in the US a sea serpent washes up and in Morocco 12 goats stand stock still in a tree. It's a weird world, and Chris Packham explains why.

Off the west coast of America sea stars are in trouble, tearing off their own limbs off which then wander away themselves.

4vuv6uKs0XU,2020-07-20,Trump falsely touts US Covid-19 death rate,"During a meandering and occasionally hostile interview with Fox News, President Donald Trump made a very bold claim: that the United States has the lowest mortality rate from Covid-19 anywhere in the world.
""I heard we have one of the lowest, maybe the lowest, mortality rate anywhere in the world,"" Trump told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace. ""Do you have the numbers please? I heard we had the best mortality rate,"" he added to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who was off-camera.
When McEnany returned with a piece of paper, Trump turned on Wallace. ""Number one low mortality rate,"" he said, attacking Wallace for reporting ""fake news"" in the process. ""You said we had the worst mortality rate in the world, and we have the best.""
But the President's claim is not true. And it's not even close.
The US in fact has one of the highest death rates from the coronavirus of any country, and is worse than several badly-hit countries like Brazil, Mexico and Russia, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

The election had been scheduled to be held on September 19.

Pressure had been mounting on Ardern to postpone the vote amid the resurgence of COVID-19 infections in its biggest city Auckland, after the country had been free of coronavirus cases for 102 days.

uB5-8Ag942I,2020-04-20,Top 15 Foods To Boost Your Immunity: How To Boost Natural Immunity,"Top 15 Foods To Boost Your Immunity: How To Boost Natural Immunity/
Food for immunity boost

1. Citrus fruits

Most people turn to vitamin C after they've caught a cold. That’s because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.
And most Popular citrus fruits like:
grapefruit
oranges
lemons
as your body doesn't produce or store it, you need daily vitamin C for your health. Almost all citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. With such a variety to choose from, it's easy to add a squeeze of this vitamin to any meal.


2. Red bell peppers

If you think citrus fruits have the most vitamin C of any fruit or vegetable, think again. red bell peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus. They’re also a rich source of beta carotene. Beta carotene helps keep your eyes and skin healthy. Beta-carotene is a powerful antioxidant that can reduce inflammation and boost immune function by increasing disease-fighting cells in the body. Excellent sources include sweet potatoes, carrots, and green leafy vegetables.



3. Broccoli

Broccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fiber, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible — or better yet, not at all.


4. Garlic

Garlic is found in almost every cuisine in the world. It adds a little zing to food and it's a must-have for your health. Early civilizations recognized its value in fighting infections. garlic may also help lower blood pressure and slow down hardening of the arteries. Garlic’s immune-boosting properties seem to come from a heavy concentration of sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin.



5. Ginger

Ginger is another ingredient many turn to after getting sick. Ginger may help decrease inflammation, which can help reduce a sore throat and other inflammatory illnesses. Ginger may also help decrease nausea.
While it's used in many sweet desserts, ginger packs some heat in the form of gingerol, a relative of capsaicin. Ginger may help decrease chronic pain and may possess cholesterol-lowering properties.


6. Spinach

Spinach made our list not just because it's rich in vitamin C. It's also packed with numerous antioxidants and beta carotene, which may increase the infection-fighting ability of our immune systems. Similar to broccoli, spinach is healthiest when it’s cooked as little as possible so that it retains its nutrients. However, light cooking enhances its vitamin A and allows other nutrients to be released from oxalic acid.

7. Yogurt

Look for yogurts that have ""live and active cultures"" printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases. Try to get plain yogurts rather than the kinds that are preflavored and loaded with sugar. You can sweeten plain yogurt yourself with healthy fruits and a drizzle of honey instead.
Yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortified with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our body’s natural defenses against diseases.

8. Almonds

When it comes to preventing and fighting off colds, vitamin E tends to take a backseat to vitamin C. However, vitamin E is key to a healthy immune system. It’s a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning it requires the presence of fat to be absorbed properly. Nuts, such as almonds, are packed with the vitamin and also have healthy fats. A half-cup serving, which is about 46 whole, shelled almonds, provides nearly 100 percent of the recommended daily amount of vitamin E.

9. Turmeric

You may know turmeric as a key ingredient in many curries. But this bright yellow, bitter spice has also been used for years as an anti-inflammatory in treating both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It has high concentrations of curcumin , which gives turmeric its distinctive color, and can help decrease exercise-induced muscle damage.

10. Green tea

Both green and black teas are packed with flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. green tea really excels in its levels of epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG which is another powerful antioxidant. EGCG has been shown to enhance immune function. The fermentation process black tea goes through destroys a lot of the EGCG. Green tea, on the other hand, is steamed and not fermented, so the EGCG is preserved.
Green tea is also a good source of the amino acid L-theanine. L-theanine may aid in the production of germ-fighting compounds in your T-cells.

#Coronavirus #COVID-19 #Virus

COVID-19 is the short name for the disease known as novel coronavirus disease 2019. Coronaviruses are a large group of similar viruses. Some are known to infect humans, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The one that causes COVID-19 is called SARS-CoV-2. All coronaviruses are named for the crown-like “spikes” that cover their surface, called spike, or “S,” proteins. Inside the virus, genetic material, called RNA, is made up of genes. Genes carry the information to make more copies of the virus. The virus can infect you if it enters your mouth, nose, or lungs. Inside your body, the S protein of the virus locks to a receptor on the surface of one of your cells. This can trigger the virus to enter the cell in a couple of ways. It may cause the virus to fuse with the cell surface, then release its genes into the cell. Or, the cell may pull the virus inside by enclosing it in a sac. Once inside, the virus can fuse to the sac and release its genes. Next, the genes use a structure in your cell, called a ribosome, to make new copies of the virus. The new viruses travel to the surface of the cell. There, they can leave to infect more cells. In the meantime, viral S proteins left on the surface of the infected cell can cause it to fuse with nearby healthy cells, forming a giant cell. This may be another way for the virus to spread between cells. People may be infected with COVID-19 for two to fourteen days before symptoms appear. The three main symptoms of COVID-19 are: a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include: tiredness, body aches, stuffy nose, sore throat, diarrhea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and loss of smell. Most people have a mild illness and can recover at home. Some people who have the virus may not get sick at all or may show no symptoms. But, if you have trouble breathing, or any other symptoms that are severe, call your doctor or the emergency room. They will tell you what to do. For most people who have the virus, the risk for serious illness is thought to be low. People sixty-five years and older may have a higher risk for serious illness. And, people of any age may be at high-risk if they have underlying conditions, such as: chronic lung disease or asthma; serious heart conditions; diabetes; severe obesity; chronic kidney disease, and liver disease. High-risk groups also include people with a weakened immune system, including: those on certain medications, such as corticosteroids;  people in cancer treatment; and those with HIV or AIDS.  Even if you aren’t in a high-risk group, it’s important to practice social distancing, which means keeping at least two meters, or six feet, between you and other people. This helps prevent infections and serious illness in others as well as yourself. For up-to-date information about COVID-19 and other ways to prevent its spread, visit the CDC website.

https://www.instagram.com/visualscience/

Biomedical visualization studio Visual Science has created the most detailed and scientifically accurate 3D model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at atomic resolution. The model is based on the latest scientific research into the structure of coronaviruses, as well as input from expert virologists involved in the research. This is the most accurate model of the SARS-CoV-2 viral particle currently available. To produce it, Visual Science employed the same techniques of structural bioinformatics used in basic research and drug development.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus model is a part of Visual Science's non-commercial Viral Park project. Viral Park's past successes include models of HIV, influenza A/H1N1, Ebola, papilloma, and Zika virions.

We use the same color scheme throughout the whole Viral Park project. Bright colors show the proteins encoded by the viral genome. Shades of gray correspond to the structures taken by viruses from the host cell. Thus we emphasize the parasitic and non-autonomous nature of the viruses.",Visual Science,UCEsum-txAsb_hIePvnXhyrQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEsum-txAsb_hIePvnXhyrQ,284396.0,89.0,1520.0,100.0,[],,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/y6VC9UqAXHA/sddefault.jpg,,,,,covid-19,pseudoscience,,7

Emergency angioplasty is an operation that is performed directly after a heart attack, on admission to the hospital. It involves the insertion of a catheter into the blocked blood vessel that caused the heart attack. This opens it up and allows blood to flow again, thus minimizing damage to the heart.
If one or more arteries become clogged, it may result in a heart attack. This normally presents with chest pain, sweating and a feeling of anxiety, among other symptoms. Urgent medical assistance should be sought. A heart attack is a medical emergency requiring intervention as soon as possible.

--

When a new pathogen emerges, our bodies and healthcare systems are left vulnerable. And when this pathogen causes the outbreak of a pandemic, there’s an urgent need for a vaccine to create widespread immunity with minimal loss of life. So how quickly can we develop vaccines when we need them most? Dan Kwartler describes the three phases of vaccine development.

1jVNeSnVSks,2020-04-17,How to Obtain a Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen for COVID-19 suspected patients,"How to Obtain a Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen for COVID-19 suspected patients

Overview
--------------
Collection of specimens from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs is a procedure used for the diagnosis of Covid-19 in adults and children.1-4 The procedure is also commonly used to evaluate patients with suspected respiratory infection caused by other viruses and some bacteria. This video describes the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens for the detection of COVID-19, the illness caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

There are no specific contraindications for collecting specimens with nasopharyngeal swabs. However, clinicians should be cautious if the patient has had recent nasal trauma or surgery, has a markedly deviated nasal septum, or has a history of chronically blocked nasal passages or severe coagulopathy.

Preparation and Equipment
---------------------------------------------
Nasopharyngeal swabs are specifically manufactured to have long, flexible shafts made of plastic or metal and tips made of polyester, rayon, or flocked nylon. In addition to nasopharyngeal swabs, you will need personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, nonsterile gloves, a protective mask, and a face shield, as described below. Make sure that all sample tubes have been labeled and that the appropriate requisition forms have been filled out before starting the procedure.
It is essential that you follow the pertinent respiratory and contact precautions specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and by your own institution and that you put on the PPE correctly. If possible, you should put on and take off the PPE in the presence of an observer to make sure there are no breaks in technique that may pose a risk of contamination.

First, put on a protective gown, wash your hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based solution), and put on a pair of nonsterile gloves. Then put on a protective mask with a rating of N95 or higher, as recommended by the CDC. Finally, put on a face shield for face and eye protection

Handling the Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the collection tube and insert the swab into the tube. Break the swab at the groove and discard what remains of the swab. Close the labeled collection tube and place it in a biohazard bag (Figure 4). Depending on institutional practices, you may instead return the sample to its original packaging for transport. Follow the CDC directions for direct processing of the swab specimen or placement of the swab in media with or without refrigeration.

Removing Personal Protective Equipment
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove your PPE as shown in the video and described here or in accordance with the standards at your institution. First, remove your gown and gloves. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based solution or soap and water. Put on a new pair of gloves, and then remove your face shield and either dispose of it or clean and store it in accordance with the guidelines at your institution. Remove your gloves, rewash your hands, and put on another pair of gloves; then remove your mask and follow your institutional guidelines for disposal or reuse. Finally, remove the last pair of gloves and wash your hands.

Summary
----------------
This video demonstrates the collection of specimens from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs for the diagnosis of Covid-19 in adults and in children. It is important to use approved PPE and the appropriate technique to minimize the possibility of spreading the virus

--

Your hands, up close, are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? Alex Rosenthal and Pall Thordarson investigate.

The film shows how to make the basic homemade oral rehydration solution using sugar, salt , and safe water as these items were felt to be most widely available.  However, a solution prepared with a readymade ORS packet is the first choice if supplies are available.

Polymerase chain reaction is a technique used to massively multiply DNA, so that it can be analyzed using other techniques. It requires a thermal cycler, filled with the DNA sample to be multiplied, thermostable Taq polymerase, primers with which we select what gets multiplied, and free nucleotides of all 4 types - A, T, C and G. The first step is denaturation, then there’s annealing, and finally extension.

Having bones is pretty cool. They make our blood, let us hear, and keep us from being just a squishy puddle on the floor. But for every species with bones, there are at least 20 species on Earth with exoskeletons instead. And those exoskeleton animals are incredibly tough and strong. So why don’t WE have our skeletons on the outside? This is the story of bones!

In part 3 of our special series on human ancestry, we investigate how closely related we all really are. Basic math tells us that all humans share ancestors. But you’ll be amazed at how recently those shared ancestors lived. Thanks to genetic data in the 21st century, we’re even discovering that we really are all descended from one mother.

He said the people had been waiting for the government to announce its economic stimulus packages to help them cushion the impact of the epidemic.

This was in response to a question posed by Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim that lawmakers were not allowed to debate the billions of ringgit of packages that may put a strain on the nation's finance.

Many people are wearing face masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 when they go out in public. This video will help not only healthcare professionals but non-healthcare professional learn how to wear and take off a surgical face mask.

Some common mistakes people make when wearing a face mask is that they do one or more of the following: wear the mask upside down or backwards, place the mask under the nose rather than over, don't tuck the bottom of the mask under the chin, or just hang the mask from one ear.

PV050lUShjo,2017-02-09,How to Use COPAN's Flocked Swabs (FLOQSwabs™) and UTM™ for Nasopharyngeal Sample Collection,"This video is intended for nurses, lab technicians and other clinical staff, and provides simple step-by-step instructions for using Copan's flocked swabs (FLOQSwabs™) and UTM for nasopharyngeal sample collection.  

For respiratory virus detection, the nasopharynx is the preferred sample site and a flocked swab with a small tip and flexible shaft, or nasal aspirate is the means for collection.

Scientific studies show that flocked swabs are equivalent in efficacy to the more invasive nasal aspirate.  The velvet brush texture of a flocked swab helps to dislodge infected cells, and the perpendicular arrangement of the fibers absorb sample by capillarity.    

Specimen collection should be performed by health care personnel who have completed training and demonstrated competency.  Always read the manufacturer’s package insert for specific instruction regarding specimen collection and transport for the type of test kit being used. 

For best results, follow steps outlined in this video and briefly summarized here:
• Check for nasal obstructions that may interfere with sampling 
• With the patient’s head tilted slightly back, gently insert the swab into the nostril keeping the swab near the septum floor of the nose while gently pushing the swab into the post-nasopharynx.  
• As a visual reference, the swab should be inserted about half the distance from the patient’s nostril and the ear.  
• Remove the cap from the tube and insert the swab into the transport container all the way to the bottom of the tube 
• Holding the tube away from your face, grasp the swab shaft above the pre-molded breakpoint and break the swab shaft at the breakpoint
• Screw the cap on tightly to prevent leakage
• Label and send specimen to testing lab following your SOP’s

FLOQSwabs™ immediately release sample into liquid media.  Since there is no inner core to trap sample, recovery is dramatically improved over traditional fiber wound swabs.

The unique ergonomic and anatomic design improves patient comfort and specimen collection.

For ages I’ve been thinking about doing a video analyzing time travel in fiction and doing a comparison of different fictional time travels – some do use wormholes, some relativistic/faster than light travel with time dilation, some closed timelike curves, some have essentially “magic” or no consistent rules that make any sense, or TARDIS's, or whatever. This video is an explanation of how time travel functions in different popular movies, books, & shows – not how it works “under the hood"", but how it causally affects the perspective of characters’ timelines (who has free will? can you change things by going back to the past or forwards into the future?). In particular, I explain Ender's Game, Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Primer, Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day, Looper, the video game “Braid”, and Lifeline.

OTMELHUAzSM,2019-06-20,Our Ignorance About Gravity,"Thanks to the Heising Simons Foundation (https://www.hsfoundation.org/) for their support of this video, and of short range gravity research.

This video is about how little we know about the behavior of gravity at short length and distance scales, what the constraints are on the inverse square law/Newton's law of universal gravitation, at the human and microscopic and atomic scales. Only on solar system scales or larger do we have good constraints on Newton's law of gravitation.

This video is about the Portal Paradox - a paradox in the video game Portal (and Portal 2) regarding whether or not a companion cube passing through a moving portal plops out of the other end with no speed (velocity, momentum), or shoots out at high speed. It’s a question of conservation of momentum, relativity of velocities, wormholes, 3D printers and quantum teleportation, glitches, and more.

In US news and current events today, teacher Amanda Coffman resigned on the spot during a school board meeting and delivered a powerful message to her former students. 

Coffman is a former teacher at Indian Woods Middle School in Kansas. She says she resigned because she felt ‘silenced’ when Shawnee Mission School District issued teachers new 3-year contracts. 

Coffman says the contracts don’t address the concerns or needs that the teachers have fought for in the past.

Listen to Amannda Coffman's fiery resignation speech to the Kansas school board here. Here is how she plans to continue the fight for better education in America.

A President Donald Trump state of the union address wouldn't be complete without a Trump fact check. In the latest US news, President Trump delivered his 2nd state of the union address last night. It is custom for the White House leader to deliver an annual address to Congress and is one of the biggest politics news events of the year. Flanked by Nancy Pelosi over his left shoulder and Senators including Bernie Sanders in the crowd, Trump addressed a number of issues in his state of the union. Recently Trump has been working hard to get a border wall and more border security. As with any Donald Trump speech, there were a number of false claims and lies that needed a fact check.

In US news and current events today, NowThis News hit the streets of New York to ask everyday Americans about the universal health care debate. A recent video featuring British people commenting on the health care system in America went viral, consider this video the answer. These people gave their thoughts on private healthcare vs public health care. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, health insurance is more available in the U.S., but without a public health care or National health care system like the U.K. or Canada, many people in the U.S. will still be uninsured and at risk.

Hi guys. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are oral prescription drugs that have been used for treatment of malaria and certain inflammatory conditions. Nowadays there are case reports or trials suggesting the use of Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with Azithromycin

In this video, we will talk about when & how to use, side effects, dosing and various studies on these medications in COVID 19 or SARS COV2. Do watch the video till the end. 

Recently randomized study from China in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 found no difference in recovery rates.

These drugs should be used only for:
1. treatment of COVID 19 positive patients
2. as prophylaxis for Asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and also for Asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases
Physicians should educate themselves about the strength of available data regarding HCQ and CQ in treating COVID-19. They should avoid misuse of HCQ and CQ for the prophylaxis of COVID-19, because there are absolutely no data to support this. 

Recently there have been reports of the use of ivermectin an antiparasitic agent in the treatment of COVID-19. It's not proven yet. I will come up with a new video if any update in the treatment or management comes. Till then take very good care of yourself and our loved ones, take appropriate precautions, like good hand washing, refrain yourself from going to market places or crowded places.

In many case reports, clinicians have used ZINC (Zinc sulfate 220mg once daily for 5 days) along with HCQ and they have found good results with the combination.

Thank you guys for watching this video. Stay healthy and safe.

hBseaQTBh3E,2019-07-15,The Benefits of Zinc / Spartan Up Podcast HEALTH,"Like magnesium, zinc is a mineral that’s present in many of the body’s functions. We talked about Magnesium in another episode and if you remember it’s important because it’s involved in many different ways in your body’s cellular activity. Well zinc is another much needed mineral and let’s talk about why!

EPISODE SCRIPT

Zinc might not be as ubiquitous as magnesium, but it’s still very important to pay attention to in your diet. Why? Because the body lacks a specialized zinc storage system!
 
Zinc has a lot of benefits, but three in particular can have a big impact on your daily health.
 
First, zinc supports your immune system. While you only need a little zinc to have your immune system work well, a deficiency could have dire consequences. That’s because zinc is the ingredient necessary to activate T-cells, which are important for two reasons: 1) T-cells attack infected and cancerous cells and 2) they help to control and regulate immune responses. A measure of how important T-cells are for the immune system is that some of the worst aspects of HIV result from the virus’s attack on T-cells.
 
Second, zinc has an impact in the process of healing wounds. Specifically, it’s important because of the way it interacts with collagen. Collagen is a protein that maintains the structure in skin and other kinds of connective tissue. Zinc, in turn, helps in the production and remodeling of collagen, which is a key property that boosts tissue growth in and around a “wound bed,” thus promoting healing.
 
Third, zinc has great properties that can help you with the common cold. Many people find that zinc lozenges can help cut down on the severity and duration of a cold. One study found this zinc remedy could cut down on the length of a cold by 40 percent! The theory is that zinc helps to reduce inflammation in and around the mouth and throat, where much of the cold virus resides.
 
So, now that you know that you need zinc, where can you find it? Oysters are a great source, so if you’re at happy hour, have a few to make up for that beer! Red meat, lobster and poultry are also good sources. For vegetarians, beans, nuts, dairy products and especially whole grains help with zinc intake.
 
Since zinc isn’t stored in the body, people who are prone to zinc deficiencies either have trouble absorbing it, take in too little, or use up too much. In the first case you’ll find people with digestive disorders or diseases associated with metabolism, like liver disease. In the second case, vegetarians who aren’t eating oysters and red meat could become zinc deficient without some compensating strategies. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding use a lot of zinc for their baby’s needs and may also run low.
 
Remember, because your body can’t store this important mineral, don’t take it for granted. Think zinc.
 
 
Key Terms and Ideas:
 
The only source of zinc comes from what we eat (either from food or supplements) because the body lacks a specialized zinc storage system.
 
T-cells are a “type of white blood cell that is of key importance to the immune system and is at the core of adaptive immunity, the system that tailors the body's immune response to specific pathogens. The T cells are like soldiers who search out and destroy the targeted invaders.” (MedicineNet)
 
Collagen is a protein that maintains the structure in skin and other kinds of connective tissue.

For months, Hong Kong was seen as an example of how a community could successfully contain Covid-19. The city was quick to isolate and trace infections and implemented measures to keep the public safe, moves which kept the number of cases relatively low. But after three weeks of zero local infections, Covid-19 cases in the city started to soar and Hong Kong entered its ""third wave."" So what happened to change things so suddenly?

The retracted COVID 19 studies primarily focused on the efficacy and associated mortality of the medications hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ace-inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers, and relied on data from a small company called Surgisphere.  The Guardian first reported about and error in the Surgisphere data set which has served to undermine the validity of these studies for many including most of the authors of the studies themselves (This video was recorded June 5, 2020).

RwjlN-awYIg,2020-08-06,Why Trump can’t let Greenland go,"Last year, President Trump reportedly floated the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark, even after he was told it was not for sale. This summer on a trip to Denmark, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked again about the President’s interest in buying Greenland -- and Pompeo did not shut it down. Chris Cillizza explains what exactly is going on with Trump and Greenland, and why this idea just won’t go away.

It sounds concerning — if the virus is changing, that could imply that it’s getting worse. That’s not the case. Although it’s true that the coronavirus is mutating, that doesn’t mean it’s getting more dangerous. In fact, it can help us in our battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s how.

In this video we briefly review the two mask types used in clinical settings — the surgical mask and the N95 mask. We take a deeper look at the more effective N95 mask and the contract transmission risk associated with reuse. We also examine extra precautions set out by the CDC to reduce the risk of contact transmission. We review and discuss several articles on decontamination methods and preventing compromisation of the proper fit of the mask.

uCIC8MwBebU,2020-05-04,COVID-19 Update 18: When are patients really infectious?,"Individuals are infectious with COVID-19 when they're shedding the virus, which means that the virus replicates in the cells of their upper or lower respiratory tract. In this video, we will examine published articles discussing viral shedding, the incubation period (mean incubation period was 5.2 days) and the serial interval, by examining the results of 77 COVID-19 transmission pairs. 

The study found that infectiousness starts 2.3 days before symptom onset. That patients are most infectious 0.7 days before symptom onset.They also found that 44% of infectiousness or infections occurred in the pre-symptomatic phase making it difficult to track.

rMWdPRhu_p8,2020-04-09,Coronavirus: German study shows COVID-19 might not be fatal as previously thought,"Professor Hendrick Streeck, University of Bonn director of the Institute of Virology and Institute for HIV Research, joins 'Closing Bell' to discuss the university's antibody study and what it means for the coronavirus pandemic.

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others.

But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors.

In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany’s decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.’s decision to only test symptomatic cases.

Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany’s less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors.

“I think so far we’ve been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,” he told CNBC Thursday.

In addition to that, Barcade allowed us to film their collection of arcades. https://barcadenewyork.com/

Today’s phones are hard to put down. Push notifications buzz in your pocket, red bubbles demand attention, and endless distractions sit at your fingertips. It can feel impossible to pull away from. But that’s kind of the point. When people talk about the “attention economy,” they’re referring to the fact that your time and attention are the currency on which today’s applications make money. Because apps profit off of the total time you spend on their platform, there’s a strong incentive to use psychological tricks  to keep you endlessly hooked. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Tristan Harris, who runs Time Well Spent, is working to create a world where platforms can more honestly respect their users’ time.

uAvs_0Nctek,2019-11-02,Why Am I Always Tired? Avoid These 6 Energy Vampires | Exhausted,"Why Am I Always Tired? Avoid These 6 Energy Vampires | Exhausted

As we get older, we lose mitochondria, the energy-producing engines in the cells. And because of that,  we produce less adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is the molecule that provides energy to cells throughout our bodies.

Other causes of fatigue, such as medication side effects or chronic illnesses like depression or heart disease, can make you feel tired or sluggish.

But age- and disease-related factors aren't the only things that suck your energy.

Lifestyle habits also play a part in fatigue.

Toll Like Receptors: The GateKeepers of Innate Immunity
 
Innate immunity as the first line of defense 
The innate immune system is an ancient host defense mechanism found in almost every multicellular organism from plants to humans. In invertebrates it is the sole mechanism of defense against pathogens but in higher vertebrates constitutes the first line of defense. The role of the innate immune system is not an insignificant one; not only must it discriminate between self and non-self as well as distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes, it also plays an important role in triggering and optimizing the adaptive immune response. This remarkable system allows an immediate non-specific response against microorganisms whereas the adaptive immunity mounts a specific response against the invading pathogen during the late phase of the infection.",IMGENEX,UCenM2tBeoH-m6tbuuVfKPew,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCenM2tBeoH-m6tbuuVfKPew,1299323.0,367.0,10347.0,330.0,[],"['Immune response', 'TLR', 'Toll Like Receptors', 'immunology', 'Antibodies', 'antibody', 'Toll-like Receptor', 'medical', 'animation', 'Response', 'Immune', 'pathogen', 'antigen', 'cell', 'cellular', 'Medicine', 'Cell (biology)', 'Health', 'blood', 'Leukocytes', 'protein', 'macrophage', 'proteins']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iVMIZy-Y3f8/sddefault.jpg,,,,,covid-19,pseudoscience,,8

How COVID19 spreads? why Lockdown, Self-isolation, Physical distancing, and Quarantine is important

The news cycle the world over is now entirely focussed on the coronavirus pandemic, the dangers of COVID-19 and the importance of “social distancing” and why we should do everything to “flatten the curve”. You may be wondering what all this means, so here we aim to break down the jargon and explain the terminology that’s being used in relation to Coronavirus prevention measures. 

What does Quarantine Mean?
Quarantine does not have to be scary, rather it is an effective way to protect the public. It is defined as separating and restricting the movement of people who are exposed or are potentially exposed to a contagious disease. A quarantine keeps such people away from others so they don’t unknowingly infect anyone in their vicinity. It is used by Governments to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. 

Quarantines may be used in times of:

Outbreaks: The sudden rise of cases of a disease in a region.
Epidemics: Outbreak of a disease over a larger area or all over a country.
Pandemics: Widespread disease involving the entire planet, affecting a lot of people globally.
In response to suspected or confirmed coronavirus exposure, people have been taken into quarantine or have been asked to self-quarantine. It is highly recommended that you strictly follow the same.

Who is Quarantined?
Anyone who has had close contact with someone who is a confirmed case of coronavirus infection. Close contact is defined as being within 2 meters or 6 feet from a person infected with COVID-19 for a prolonged time. This includes living with, visiting, or sharing a closed space with the infected person. 

Self-isolation
Isolation, unlike quarantine, is when a person confirmed to have a contagious disease has to separate themselves from healthy individuals around them. This is done to prevent the spread of infection among the common masses. 

Self-isolation versus Quarantine
While isolation achieves the same purpose as quarantine, it is only for those who are infected or are confirmed cases of COVID-19. Quarantines last for the duration of the upper limit of the incubation period of the virus, which is 14 days in this case. However, isolation lasts until the individual is free of symptoms and tests negative for the virus.

What should you do in quarantine or isolation?
If you are within the limits of your home, do not leave unless it is necessary. Do not attend functions, schools, churches, or temples.
Pets can stay: There is no evidence that Coronavirus can spread to your pets. However, it is advised to avoid petting, snuggling, or cuddling with your pet if you have been exposed to COVID-19.
Do not share: Keep your plates, glasses, cups, spoons, towels, and bedding separate. Do not swap any of these items unwashed.
Frequent hand washing is a must: Hygiene is a very integral part of a quarantine. Wash your hands for twenty seconds with soap and water frequently. Use your elbow to cough or sneeze into or use a tissue and immediately throw it in a covered dustbin.
Stay calm: While it is natural to feel anxious and scared, being educated about your situation is a great way to combat anxiety.
Follow instructions and co-operate with the authorities: Following the quarantine process and other public health mandates play a big role in preventing and slowing the spread of contagious diseases.
Being cooped up indoors may seem unbearable, but remember that your actions are helping save the lives of many people.

Social distancing
Social distancing means any measures taken to increase physical space between people to slow or prevent the spread of the virus. This involves avoiding public gatherings, limiting the number of visitors to your home, staying at home more often, keeping a safe distance from other people, and catching up with friends and family virtually instead of in person. 

If you have to be around people, maintain a distance of 2 meters or 6 feet from others around you as much as possible. Not just mass gatherings, but even shopping malls, stadiums, and movie theatres can make you a target. In general, any gathering of over ten people should be avoided or conducted virtually.

fx3oLZryzuo,2020-08-04,Trump says top U.S. generals believe explosion in Beirut was an “attack”,"U.S. President Donald Trump offered his administration's “deepest sympathies” to the people of Lebanon after an explosion in the capital Beirut that has resulted in the deaths of at least 70 people as of Tuesday, and wounded thousands more.

Trump said the explosion in Beirut “seemed like” an attack based on the expertise of a number of U.S. generals.

“They would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was an attack. It was a bomb of some kind,” he said.

A spokesperson for the Pentagon told Global News on Tuesday that it is “actively monitoring developments” but said it has “nothing to offer regarding the cause of the explosion nor its aftermath.”

According to Berlin's police spokesperson, about 180 officers were in place to uphold containment regulations as health authorities had not given permission for the gathering to take place.

Germany's confirmed COVID-19 cases had increased by 2,055 to a new total of 152,438, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday, which is a second day of deceleration after three days of acceleration in new infections.

Germany has the fifth-highest COVID-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain, Italy and France, but has kept fatalities down after early and extensive testing.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Correction at 7:48: The protester says “They are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.”

Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China’s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city’s judicial independence.

At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill. But after a series of massive protests, she announced she would “indefinitely suspend” the bill. But protesters aren't accepting the suspension, and have started demanding its complete withdrawal. They've also begun calling for Lam’s resignation.

But this rise in tensions is about a lot more than a bill. To understand why this bill hits a nerve with Hongkongers, it's important to understand Hong Kong’s relationship with China - and exactly how the bill would tip the scales in China’s favor.

T4yUR1pgJOs,2020-07-02,Covid-19 pandemic will be over by January one way or the other: Fmr. FDA chief,"Dr. Scott Gottlieb, member of the boards of Pfizer, Tempus and biotech company Illumina and former FDA commissioner, tells CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" he believes the Covid-19 pandemic will end within six months either because there will be widespread access to a vaccine or because enough people will have contracted the illness to the point where the virus stops ""spreading efficiently."" For more coronavirus live updates: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/01/coronavirus-live-updates.html 

The worst of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak will end by January either with a vaccine or because enough people in the country will have already been infected and have some immunity to it, former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CNBC on Thursday.

The restrictions and guidance implemented to curb the spread of the virus will not last forever, he said, urging people to practice public health precautions until the U.S. can safely return to normalcy. He added that it’s fine to socialize, but within reason and people should consider keeping “a small social circle.”

“This will be over by January one way or the other,” he said on “Squawk Box.” “Either we’ll get to a vaccine or we’ll just have spread enough it’s just going to stop spreading efficiently, so we have a short period of time to get through. We should do everything we can to preserve what we want of our way of life over that time period to just get through it.”

Policy makers are betting on an effective vaccine or that enough of the population will recover from the virus and achieve so-called herd immunity to curb the outbreak. However, there’s still no clear evidence that antibodies give people any protection against being reinfected.

Gottlieb sits on the board of pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which is one of the more than 10 companies with a coronavirus vaccine either currently in or preparing to begin clinical trials. On Wednesday, Pfizer reported positive results from its early-stage human trial, sending the stock up more than 3% on the day. The results have yet to be peer reviewed.

White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has previously said he’s “cautiously optimistic” a vaccine will be ready for U.S. distribution by early 2021. Several major companies with potential vaccines in development have already begun to invest in ramping up manufacturing of doses in preparation to meet demand if the vaccine candidates prove safe and effective in humans. 

Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in congressional testimony last month that he is hopeful one of the several vaccine candidates will prove safe and effective, but he warned that “there’s never a guarantee.” It’s also likely that any coronavirus vaccine would not provide life-long immunity, but rather would create some protection for a limited period of time, Fauci said.

“You can have everything you think that’s in place and you don’t induce the kind of immune response that turns out to be protective and durably protective,” Fauci said of a vaccine. “So one of the big unknowns is, will it be effective? Given the way the body responds to viruses of this type, I’m cautiously optimistic that we will, with one of the candidates, get an efficacy signal.”

Even without a vaccine, Gottlieb said there’s a chance the virus could stop spreading efficiently in the U.S. by January if enough people get it and develop antibodies, which scientists believe offer some protection against infection. However, Fauci and other scientists have stressed that researchers do not fully understand the role of antibodies in this virus.

The relationship between antibodies and immunity is one of the many questions researchers are now seeking to answer about the coronavirus, which emerged just seven months ago. Whether the presence of certain kinds of antibodies equates to immunity against infection and how long that immunity might last are two key questions that remain unanswered.

A study published last month in Nature Medicine found coronavirus antibodies might last only two to three months after a person becomes infected. Researchers examined 37 asymptomatic people, those who never developed symptoms, in the Wanzhou District of China. They compared their antibody response to that of 37 people with symptoms.

The grandmother of a 6-year-old boy who was found huddled in a hiding space along with his mother faced new charges today in the alleged abduction, just hours after she said she did nothing wrong in helping to hide her family and keep the little boy safe.

While police have said Diane Dobbs' house was full of hidden nooks and secret rooms where Richard ""Ricky"" Chekevdia was hidden from the world, Dobbs told ""Good Morning America"" that ""in two years time, [the boy spent] maybe five minutes"" in the crawl space.

JNaY_b8eZds,2018-12-23,Doctor Reacts to: FUNNIEST MEDICAL MEMES!,"Catch Medical Memes Ep. 2 Here: https://youtu.be/hA4a6BG1Jn0

Medical memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be dark and if taken out of context can even seem offensive BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. 

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

JFamzSTQXsw,2020-06-16,Blood Type and COVID - Does Blood Type Matter for COVID?,"Blood Type and COVID - Does Blood Type Matter for COVID?

People have either blood types A, B, AB, or O.
Are people with blood type O less prone to suffer from COVID?
And does blood type A make people more prone to COVID?

Let me first start out by saying that people of all blood types can get COVID. And people with all blood types can possibly die of COVID if they get the infection.

Based on several different studies, it looks like people with blood type O have less chance of getting COVID, and people with type A might have a higher chance of getting the infection.

Data from China was the first to show the ABO blood group association with COVID infections.

The researcher Zhao and others compared ABO blood groups of controls from the general population with over 2100 COVID patients from three hospitals in Wuhan.

Across all three hospitals, blood group A was associated with a higher risk for COVID than non-A blood groups. Whereas blood group O was associated with a significantly lower risk for infection compared with non-O blood groups.

Another observational study on data from the New York-Presbyterian hospital system happened where I did my fellowship training. Over 1500 people tested for COVID, and they had similar results with blood types.

There was another study done by Andre Franke in Italy and Spain.

In this study, they looked at DNA samples from 1,980 COVID patients hospitalized for respiratory failure. And the study produced similar results.

But what about the severity of illness?

Does having blood type ""O"" make someone less likely to have a severe illness from COVID, compared to type B, type AB, and type A?

Zhao and others looked at the case fatality rate, and blood group A was linked to higher mortality risk than blood group O.

Interestingly, blood type association is not explainable by other risk factors, like obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure.

Recently, a study published by the personal genetics company 23andMe regarding evidence that blood type plays a role in COVID.

So if you don’t know, 23 and I is a company that sends out personal genetics testing kits to individuals interested in discovering their genetic history and predisposition to certain genetically transmitted diseases.
 
According to their website, they did a study based on over 750,000 people.

Their preliminary results suggest that O blood type appears to be slightly less susceptible to contracting the virus.

But the big question is why?

No one really knows, but there are a lot of hypotheses.

BLOOD TYPE is determined by genetics, and the genes determine the specific proteins on the cell's surface. These proteins then have particular sugar molecules that are added to them.  Therefore, they exist in our blood cells and other cell types.

People who are blood type A carry A-sugar-antigens.

People who are blood type B carry B-sugar-antigens.

People with O blood type have neither A nor B-sugar antigens.

What is the significance of this?

This means that the immune systems of people with type A blood develop antibodies for B antigens.

People with type B blood type have antibodies for A antigens.

People with type O blood have antibodies for both A and B antigens.

People with AB blood type will have neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies.

And here is an interesting fact we knew before COVID.

Studies are showing that people with type O blood have lower levels of proteins that promote blood clotting.

More specifically, people with blood group O have about 25%  lower von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels than those with types A, B, or AB. This is due to the increased clearance of VWF from the circulation.

VWF is always involved in developing clots, so if there is less VWF, there’s likely to be less clotting. So this might explain why Type O blood type means fewer blood clots, which might partially explain why people with Type O overall have less severe disease. Because, as you probably know already, lots of people with COVID pneumonia also have blood clots.

jrwSo9ZDZEg,2020-06-17,Dexamethasone for COVID - GOOD NEWS! 😀,"Dexamethasone for COVID - GOOD NEWS! 😀

Dexamethasone is being called a “Major Breakthrough” based on a recent RCT in the UK. Dexamethasone (Decadron) is an example of a glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are sometimes referred to as corticosteroids. Other examples of glucocorticoids include Hydrocortisone, Methylprednisolone, Prednisolone, Prednisone, Betamethasone, and Triamcinolone. Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor in the body. Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the glucocorticoid we naturally make in our body. It is essential for life, regulating or supporting various cardiovascular, metabolic, and homeostatic functions. It also plays a big role in our immune system, especially when reducing certain aspects of inflammation. 

This is why we use them all the time in medicine. We sometimes give these steroids for asthma, COPD, rheumatologic type diseases, and countless more diseases. Sometimes we give steroids for meningitis and also for some forms of cancer. In the early course of severe ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, we give them ARDS due to infection such as pneumonia, vaping lung injury, or whatever the cause. 

For severe ARDS, we typically give methylprednisone at a 1 mg/kg dose per day. So for most people, that ends being around 80 mg per day. This is the equivalent of 15 mg of dexamethasone for covid. The idea here is to suppress the cytokine storm that occurs, meaning that a massive amount of inflammation that causes lung damage can indirectly cause damage to e to other organs. Our body naturally makes cortisol in our adrenal glands, specifically in the adrenal cortex's zona fasciculate. 

The adrenal gland then secretes cortisol into the bloodstream, travels to different body tissues, and binds to the glucocorticoid receptor inside cells. It then stimulates the cell to make more anti-inflammatory proteins and reduces the number of pro-inflammatory proteins. But giving someone glucocorticoids (steroids) who has an infection is somewhat of a tricky thing because the fear is that if you suppress the body’s immune system, it has the potential to make the infection worse. But sometimes, es the body’s immune system does more damage than the actual infection. For example, in meningitis cases, we give steroids due to streptococcus or tuberculosis because the medical evidence shows better outcomes when we do so. 

Giving someone steroids for viral pneumonia, such as influenza, is more controversial because doing so generally leads to a worse infection. With that said, if the viral pneumonia is so bad to the point of causing severe ARDS, most doctors, including myself, will give steroids in that situation. This is why the general medical guidelines thus far recommend against giving steroids for COVID pneumonia unless the patient has severe ARDS. We’ve been waiting for RCT to come out for steroids and COVID, and here we are now. In March 2020, the RECOVERY (Randomized Evaluation of Covid therapy) trial was one RCT that looked at several potential treatments for COVID, including low-dose dexamethasone (a steroid treatment). This trial was done in the UK and had over 11,500 patients in it. 

So this trial has not been peer-reviewed as of the making of this video and has not been published in a journal yet. So everything I know so far is based on what has been released to the general public. In this trial, over 2100 patients were randomized to receive dexamethasone 6 mg once per day for ten days and were compared with over 4300 patients randomized to standard care alone. So 6 mg of dexamethasone is the equivalent of 32 mg of methylprednisolone, so this is about half the dose we would typically use for someone with severe ARDS. 

Among the patients who received standard care alone, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required mechanical ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any supplementary oxygen (13%). For patients on ventilators, dexamethasone reduced mortality from 41% to 28%. For patients needing supplemental oxygen, it reduced mortality from 25% to 20%. There was no benefit among those patients who did not require supplemental oxygen. 

In other words, if someone only has mild disease, there is no point in giving dexamethasone. Based on these results, 1 de@th would be prevented by treating around 8 ventilated patients and around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone. So these preliminary results are significant but do not mean that dexamethasone is a miracle drug. It's certainly not a cure. But it does seem to help, based on these numbers. And dexamethasone could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid patients because it is very cheap & widely available.

ec6XslfVSDE,2020-04-09,Ivermectin being studied for COVID,"Ivermectin being studied for COVID

Ivermectin is an FDA-approved medication for parasitic infections. Ivermectin is widely available due to its inclusion on the WHO model list of essential medicines. It opens glutamate-sensitive chloride channel currents in helminths, and it is widely believed that this is how it kills certain parasites. It's the drug of choice for the treatment of onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. So why might Ivermectin work against COVID?

Once the virus gains entry into the body's cells, using the ACE2 receptor, the virus releases its messenger RNA into the cell. Then, the cell starts to translate the mRNA from the virus, which starts to make viral proteins, and that’s how the new virus forms. 

Some of these viral proteins that are freshly made then enter into the cell's nucleus, or are at least thought to do so by many scientists, which probably impairs our cells' ability to fight off the infection. These viral proteins are thought to gain entry into our cells' nucleus through specific channels of a different protein, called importin. Not important, importin. There's importin type alpha, importin beta. Or Imp for short, so imp alpha, imp beta.

---------------------------------------------------------

And this is where ivermectin comes in because ivermectin inhibits the passage of these viral proteins into the nucleus. It does so by binding to these protein channels and effectively blocking the transport of molecules through them. So this is why scientists started studying ivermectin. And this recent article that just came out on April 3rd in the journal Antiviral Research.  This is a pre-proof article, meaning they have been peer-reviewed, but the final publication is still pending. These scientists found that ivermectin significantly inhibits the COVID viral proteins in their passage from the cytoplasm into the nucleus of cells in vitro.

In vitro means this was done in a test tube or outside of a living organism. 
A single dose of Ivermectin had ∼a 5000-fold reduction in virus levels at 48h in cell culture. So this drug has a huge impact on this virus in vitro. And that is why the authors of this study conclude that these drugs need to be studied in COVID patients, meaning in clinical trials. Other drugs are being looked at in clinical trials for COVID, such as redeliver, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. 

Because Ivermectin is generally considered a safe drug and is already FDA approved for other diseases, it can be repurposed for COVID as long as it is safe and effective for COVID patients in clinical trials. 

If this drug turns out to be the miracle drug for Covid, the next question will become, when should people start taking it? 
Because the patients with COVID who get very sick usually get sick very quickly. So this ivermectin may have to be given prophylactically or at the first onset of symptoms. 

The other question is, what are the side effects or adverse reactions? 
Well, based on what we already know about ivermectin, this is what I can tell you. 
The most common adverse reaction is the Mazzotti reaction. But this only happens when ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis, a parasitic infection. The Mazzotti reaction was first described in 1948. It’s a symptom complex seen in patients after undergoing treatment of nematode infestation, particularly with the medication diethylcarbamazine (DEC), but with ivermectin. 

Mazzotti reactions can be life-threatening and are characterized by fever, hives, generalized swelling, swollen lymph nodes, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, hypotension, joint pain, and abdominal pain.

There is a 25% chance of Mazzotti reaction when ivermectin is used to treat onchocerciasis, not other parasitic infections. So if a COVID patient took ivermectin, this would not happen. 

So, otherwise, Ivermectin is very safe, and side effects are uncommon. However, diarrhea occurs in 2% of people taking it. 

Also, Ivermectin should not be administered to pregnant or lactating women, and its safety in children less than 15 kg is unknown.

This week, they're reporting back on how their parents are doing, and what it's like to be quarantined with COVID-19-positive family members. So far, their parents' symptoms seem to be mild, but they're still maintaining social distancing and keeping six feet apart. McKenna has an underlying medical condition, so it's extra important that she doesn't catch the virus. Just to be safe, McKenna and Griffen are both getting tested for coronavirus, and they vlogged the whole experience so we can see exactly what it's like.

rb7TVW77ZCs,2015-01-12,How do vaccines work? - Kelwalin Dhanasarnsombut,"Learn the science behind how vaccines trigger an immune response and teach our bodies to recognize dangerous pathogens. 

--

The first ever vaccine was created when Edward Jenner, an English physician and scientist, successfully injected small amounts of a cowpox virus into a young boy to protect him from the related (and deadly) smallpox virus. But how does this seemingly counterintuitive process work? Kelwalin Dhanasarnsombut details the science behind vaccines.

Lesson by Kelwalin Dhanasarnsombut, animation by Cinematic.

I spent a day in Oslo before traveling to Svalbard, and noticed that there were Teslas everywhere. Upon further investigation, I learned that the Norwegian government heavily incentivizes ownership of electric cars: Tesla doesn't pay a sales tax on the models it sells, electric car owners are exempt from automobile tolls, and they can charge their vehicles for free. The catch is that Norway funds these initiatives through its sovereign wealth fund, which is almost entirely comprised of profits from Norway's oil and fossil fuel exports. 

Vox Borders is a new international series focused on telling the human stories that emerge from lines on the map. Johnny will travel to six border locations to produce a final set of documentaries. While he travels he'll release dispatches on YouTube and Facebook documenting his experiences. Learn more: http://www.vox.com/borders-dispatch

https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesmilk/

Over the last decade milk has become a bit controversial. Some people say it’s a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones, but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death.

So who is right? And why are we drinking it anyway?

▼▼ More infos and links are just a click away ▼▼

Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing. While we tried to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox that remains unsolved to this day: large animals seem to be immune to cancer. Which doesn’t make any sense – the bigger a being, the more cancer it should have. To understand why, we first need to take a look at the nature of cancer itself.

Get your Stellar Engine Infographic Poster here:
https://shop.kurzgesagt.org

Nothing in the Universe is static. In the milky way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center.
Some, like our sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years.

This dance is not an orderly ballet -  more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighbourhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second.

Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point we could encounter a star going supernova. Or a massive object passing by and showering earth with asteroids.

If something like this were to happen we would likely know thousands, if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn’t do much about it.

Unless… we move our whole solar system out of the way.

HaraFkhonFo,2020-05-05,Why we're seeing mass layoffs in the US but not the UK,"Tens of millions of Americans are out of work because of the coronavirus. But it didn't have to be that way -- and it's not too late for the US to change course.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Few Americans alive today have ever seen unemployment numbers as bad as they are right now. At the end of April 2020, economists estimated that between 13 and 18 percent of US workers were unemployed. It's the highest rate since the Great Depression. 

That figure can seem somewhat inevitable; the unfortunate but unavoidable cost of economic lockdown. It’s why, in response, Congress has prioritized shoring up unemployment insurance benefits.

But a handful of European countries have shown that mass unemployment isn’t a given in a situation like this. It’s a policy choice. 

In this video, we explain how and why the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands chose a different path. With the help of economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, we explore whether the US can still avoid millions more job losses.

3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13,Why beef is the worst food for the climate,"Avoiding high-emission foods can have a bigger climate impact than any other consumption change.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. 

The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer. 

This video was based on this chart, created by the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data:

Unfortunately, it seems like over the last few weeks we’ve become victims to “Caution Fatigue” and reverted back to the behavior that caused our new cases to spike in the first place. 

There are so many factors behind the latest spike, where 18 states are seeing a dramatic increase in new cases, with many actually soaring well above their all-time highs. Protests of all kinds are definitely a contributing factor, so please make sure you’re wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet apart from others, and remaining outdoors if you’re marching with a group of people. We will get through this!

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/episodes you'd like for me to watch. Love you all!

luTPMHC7zHY,2017-02-17,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

China's Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern history. It spans over 60 countries and will cost over a trillion dollars. The plan is to make it easier for the world to trade with China, by funding roads, railways, pipelines, and other infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa. China is loaning trillions of dollars to any country that's willing to participate and it's been a big hit with the less democratic countries in the region. This makes the BRI a risky plan as well. But China is pushing forward because its goals are not strictly economic, they're also geopolitical. 

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

3EKeMyTYowg,2020-03-26,There Is Something Weird Going On In The World Right Now…,"We are currently going through some tough times, with a new disease spreading throughout the world and the economy seemingly going through its worst period since the great depression. But, There has been a few strange things that have been happening in the background of all this chaos. 

That is because as we have seen throughout history, strange things tend to happen during desperate times.

For example, After World War 2, Tensions were high between the United States and The Soviet Union. Both superpowers began jockeying for position to see who would become the worlds one true superpower.

And this threat of war caused some of the greatest technological advancements in history.

You see, both the USSR and the United States had ballistic missiles that would launch, stay within earths atmosphere, and then eventually hit their target from hundreds of kilometres away.

But the distance between Moscow, and Washington D.C was 7800km. So if these superpowers wanted to be able to hit eachother with a nuclear strike, they would need a new piece of technology.

That is when the USSR developed the first intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM in 1957. It was the first missile capable of entering sub-orbital space, and hitting a target on the other side of the planet.

But almost by accident, the USSR had developed something else. In an effort to ensure the safety of its country, theSoviets developed ICBM's...and inadvertently built the technology that connected human civilization with space. 

Within months after their first ICBM test in 1957, the USSR used the same ICBM to launch the first satellite into Space…they called it Sputnik.

Now, today we view sputnik today as a technological masterpiece. But during its time, it was viewed as one of the scariest things in history to the western world. In fact, after the Soviets launched sputnik…it created a worldwide panic called ‘The Sputnik Crisis’ where the public experienced fear and anxiety over the technological gap between the west, and the USSR. 

The United States viewed Sputnik as a serious threat to National Security. So president Eisenhower said the The United States will respond with “Resourcefulness and Vigor”. 

The president was then able to get enough public support to create two Agencies. NASA, and DARPA…

He was also able to dramatically increase spending on Education and Research and Development.

Over the course of the next decade, the USSR and United States would keep trying to one up eachother. This was the called ‘Space Race’.

And this space race led to innovations that would reshape our entire world. For example, DARPA created the internet as a way of sending information from one point to another in a safe a secure manner during the cold war. Computers became significantly more advanced during that time. It also created spinoffs of other technologies like GPS, Cat Scans, Athletic Shoes, Water Purification, Artificial Limbs, and many more.



You see, a perceived national security threat in the 1950’s from both the USSR and The United States ended up catalyzing the creation of new technologies that would create a better world for the future.

And that might be one of the things that we are seeing today, even though it might be happening in the background. You see, Vaccines normally take about 4 years to develop from the time scientists start experimenting with new vaccine ideas, to the time where the vaccine is approved for the public. 

But this time is different. The entire world views this new virus as a threat, just like how most people in the world felt during the cold war. So more funding and public support is now going towards biotechnology research, in hopes of neutralizing the threat. 
And well, here’s what we are seeing so far. Throughout history, vaccines have worked by injecting weakened or killed versions of a virus, into the person getting the vaccine. But that process was going to take too long this time around. 

So, around the world, researches have begun experimenting with new ways to create vaccines that might be 5, 10, or even 20 times faster than before.

6mjef8NsNfU,2019-07-01,Why America Is Just Okay | NYT Opinion,"America is the greatest country on earth. It’s a phrase, a slogan, a dogma for patriots. And as we stare down the barrel of an upcoming election, we’re prepared to hear this refrain echo.

In the video Op-Ed above, we argue that the myth of America as the greatest nation on earth is at best outdated and at worst, wildly inaccurate. Comparing the United States of America on global indicators reveals we have fallen well behind Europe — and share more in common with “developing countries” than we’d like to admit.

This is something we need to act on, so to raise awareness, we went out on the street to ask people if they were worried about one endangered species in particular - 'Homo Sapiens.' Homo Sapiens, of course, are humans. So we asked humans if they care about the extinction of humans, and this is what we got back.

QPYitskzk3U,2020-08-17,Gold ETFs gain ground as Warren Buffett bets on the miners,"Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research at ETF Trends and ETF Database, and Chris Hempstead, director of institutional business development at IndexIQ, speak to gold's winning streak this year as investors pile into gold ETFs. With CNBC's Bob Pisani. Subscribe to CNBC PRO for access to investor and analyst insights on gold and more: https://cnb.cx/2BT2E7y

Barrick Gold’s stock is popping 10% Monday after legendary investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed a stake in the gold miner’s stock. 

Berkshire added a $562 million position in Barrick Gold in the second quarter, according to SEC filings Friday. While the position is small for Berkshire — which owns more than $89 billion in Apple stock — the conglomerate is the 11th largest shareholder of the gold mining company, according to FactSet. 

This was an unusual move considering Buffett, a long-time value investor, has long professed a dislike for gold, preferring assets that have cash flows or pay dividends. 

Shares of miner have surged more than 45% this year as investors rush into the safe haven metal trade during the coronavirus pandemic.

Cella Wright explores the science of PCR tests and immunoassays.

The oldest glue in the world is over 8,000 years old and comes from a cave near the Dead Sea. Today, we have enough types of tape and glue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue and tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Elizabeth Cox explores the world of adhesives.

The United Arab Emirate's Hope satellite was despatched last week and now China has launched its first rover mission to the red planet.

Nasa's Perseverance Rover is scheduled to take off on 30th July.

Well, summer 2020 is a popular time for missions to the red planet because of the way the planets align - but how long does it take to get there?

Landing on Mars is known as the ""seven minutes of terror"", and there are lots of reasons why.

Here BBC Science Correspondent Laura Foster explains how long it takes to get there and why it's so difficult.

1AS-dCdYZbo,2012-07-27,James Bond and The Queen London 2012 Performance,"📲 Subscribe to @olympics: http://oly.ch/Subscribe 

 Daniel Craig reprises his role as British secret agent James Bond as he accompanies Her Majesty The Queen to the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The Ceremony also featured appearances from Mr. Bean, Monty Python and a re-imagining of the British Industrial Revolution.

Every two years, the world's finest athletes gather at the Olympic Games - a spectacular celebration of sporting excellence that captures the attention of billions of people around the world. However, the Games are about much more than just sport. They bring the Olympic values to life and provide a global arena for a unique combination of sport, culture, education and ceremonies.

At the Olympic Games in London 2012, about 10,500 athletes from 204 countries compete in 26 different sports, comprising 302 medal events. Whether athletes win a medal or not, they can forever call themselves Olympians. The sporting competitions are undoubtedly the central focus of the Olympic Games and participating in the Games is the ultimate goal for most athletes.

Every edition has its own story to tell and will be remembered for some truly remarkable performances from sporting legends such as Jesse Owens, Abebe Bikila, Jean-Claude Killy, Nadia Comaneci, Katarina Witt, Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt, to name just a few.

Japan’s Shinkansen doesn’t look like your typical train. With its long and pointed nose, it can reach top speeds up to 150–200 miles per hour. 

It didn’t always look like this. Earlier models were rounder and louder, often suffering from the phenomenon of ""tunnel boom,"" where deafening compressed air would rush out of a tunnel after a train rushed in. But a moment of inspiration from engineer and birdwatcher Eiji Nakatsu led the system to be redesigned based on the aerodynamics of three species of birds. 

Nakatsu’s case is a fascinating example of biomimicry, the design movement pioneered by biologist and writer Janine Benyus. She's a co-founder of the Biomimicry Institute, a non-profit encouraging creators to discover how big challenges in design, engineering, and sustainability have often already been solved through 3.8 billion years of evolution on earth. We just have to go out and find them. 

This is one of a series of videos we're launching in partnership with 99% Invisible, an awesome podcast about design. 99% Invisible is a member of http://Radiotopia.fm

--- How to keep glasses from fogging when wearing a face mask ---

1. (works some of the times) Folding a piece of tissue paper and putting that under the nose bridge of your face mask or surgical mask. This will slow down hot air from rising up to the glasses. 

2. (works better in my opinion) Using surgical tape along the top of the face mask or n95 mask to create a seal so the hot air of your breath goes out the sides or the front of the mask.

** Sometimes the glasses fog a little but only a small amount and rarely remains longer than 1 second.

The coronavirus has had an enormous impact on our lives: how we work, communicate and congregate. At this point, we’re familiar with how to protect ourselves from the virus – and the disease it causes, COVID-19 – by washing our hands thoroughly, wearing masks and social distancing.

Most people who get the virus are mildly sick and will recover at home. For others, the virus can be severe, even fatal.

One significant way the virus attacks is deep in our lungs.

---+ Read the entire article on KQED Science:

https://www.kqed.org/science/1963200/how-covid-19-attacks-your-lungs

--- What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus?
The Center for Disease Control advises on its website that “symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms or combinations of symptoms may have COVID-19: Cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Or at least two of these symptoms: fever; chills; Repeated shaking with chills; muscle pain; headache; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell.” 

--- How can I protect myself from the coronavirus?
The Center for Disease Control has a comprehensive list of guidelines at cdc.gov, but the main tips to remember are: wash your hands often; avoid close contact with other people; cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover (like a mask or bandanna) when around others; cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow; regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in your home.

--- If you’ve had the new coronavirus, are you now immune?
The Center for Disease Control states on its website: “We do not know yet if having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 can protect someone from getting infected with that virus again, or how long that protection might last. Scientists are doing studies to answer those questions.”

XAtriMQPu5E,2020-07-17,Task force report says 18 states should roll back reopening,"An unpublished document prepared for the White House coronavirus task force and obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit newsroom, recommends that 18 states in the coronavirus ""red zone"" for cases should roll back reopening measures amid surging cases.
The ""red zone"" is defined in the 359-page report as ""those core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) and counties that during the last week reported both new cases above 100 per 100,000 population, and a diagnostic test positivity result above 10%.""
The report outlines measures counties in the red zone should take. It encourages residents to ""wear a mask at all times outside the home and maintain physical distance."" And it recommends that public officials ""close bars and gyms"" and ""limit social gatherings to 10 people or fewer,"" which would mean rolling back reopening provisions in these places.
The report comes despite President Donald Trump's insistence that states reopen and a push to send the nation's children back to school, even as cases increase.
""Now we're open, and we want to stay open and we will stay open. We're not closing. We'll put out the fires as they come out,"" Trump said at a White House event earlier this month.
The following 18 states are in the red zone for cases: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.

1HTionnTT9I,2020-06-08,Autopsy Comparison of COVID vs. Flu vs. Normal Lungs,"Autopsy Comparison of COVID vs. Flu vs. Normal Lungs

Both COVID and the flu can cause pneumonia and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Both of these can cause respiratory failure and death. We know that COVID is more likely to cause severe disease than influenza and has a higher case fatality rate. We also know that COVID is much more likely to cause blood clots than influenza. 

In this recent study published in the NEJM, they compared lung autopsy findings from deceased COVID patients and Influenza and compared those findings to people who died of other causes, who had normal lungs. This group, with the normal lungs, served as the control group. Pneumonia is a broad medical term that refers to an inflammation within parts of a lung or both lungs. This entails the lungs' tiny air sacs, called alveoli, to fill up with inflammatory fluid, impairs oxygen flow from the air to the bloodstream.

---------------------------------------------------------

The consequences of pneumonia, whether caused by COVID or influenza, can result in dangerously low oxygen levels in the bloodstream and, if not treated, can result in death. Sometimes if pneumonia is severe enough, it can cause ARDS, which refers to severe inflammation within both lungs, which causes extreme difficulty with getting oxygen into the blood. This is a well-known syndrome that can occur with either COVID or influenza pneumonia. 

COVID inflicts a particular type of damage in human lungs that is somewhat different from the picture we see with influenza. To understand the differences, researchers looked at the lungs of seven patients who died of respiratory failure from COVID and then compared them to the lungs of seven patients who died of pneumonia caused by influenza A. 

They also compared them to the lungs of ten uninfected lungs, which came from people whose organs had been donated for transplant but were not used, so these were normal lungs. The researchers were careful to match the gender and age, so their comparisons among the groups of patients would be meaningful. All of the lungs came from older patients whose average age in the covid group ranged from 68 years old for the females and 80 for the males. 

The influenza group's average age ranged from 62 years for the females and 55 for the males. Perhaps this research's most interesting and important finding revealed damage to the lungs' small blood vessels, meaning lung capillaries. The lining of these capillaries is called the endothelium, and the cells that make up the endothelium have ACE2 receptors. The cells were, in fact, infected with covid. In this study, the researchers found severe microscopic injuries to the endothelium here, with actual disruptions of the cell membranes. 

They also found widespread clotting in these lung capillaries surrounding the alveoli, which included actual blockage of the capillaries, and microangiopathy, which involves thickening and weakening the small blood vessel walls leak blood and protein, further slowing the flow of blood. Although fibrin clots in the alveoli's capillaries were present in the lungs from both the COVID and influenza patients, micro-clots in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli were nine times as prevalent in the lungs COVID patients as compared with the lung tissue of the influenza patients. 

What’s more, COVID patients showed actual new blood vessel growth, primarily through a process known as intussusceptive angiogenesis. The word “angiogenesis” means the formation of new blood vessels.  The term “intussusceptive” refers to something telescoping inside itself. In this context, it's referring to new blood vessels being formed by a pillar of tissue within another blood vessel, effectively splitting the vessel into two. 

The researchers believe this process contributes to more problems with clotting and inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels than is seen in the lungs of patients with influenza. Angiogenesis was seen much less frequently in patients' lungs with influenza and normal lung control. The researchers also looked at the ACE2 receptor, which allows the COVID virus to gain entry into cells. Compared to the control group's lungs, there were more ACE2-positive cells in the lungs of both COVID and influenza patients. The study speculates that the reason for more angiogenesis in the COVID group is the evidence of viral invasion of these endothelial cells.

HLxvq_M4218,2020-06-09,The eclipse photo that made Einstein famous,"In 1919, a total solar eclipse helped redefine gravity.

Thanks to Raycon for sponsoring this video. Check them out at http://buyraycon.com/vox

Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, published in 1915, defined gravity as the influence of massive objects, like planets and stars, curving space around them. This was very different from the way Isaac Newton had defined gravity over 200 years earlier: Newton described an attracting force that kept planets and stars in orbit with each other. If Einstein was right, then light would also bend near massive objects. And in 1919, two British expeditions set out to test it by photographing a total solar eclipse. By comparing the position of stars with the sun in front of them and another with the sun elsewhere, Arthur Eddington and his team proved that the stars’ apparent positions moved during the eclipse. This was the first, but not the last time Einstein’s theory of general relativity was tested and proven, and Einstein became a celebrity overnight. He remained a pop culture icon for the rest of his life.

If you saw the 2015 film ‘The Martian,’ you might recall main character Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) mentioning something called an oxygenator…well, NASA’s newest device isn’t so far off from the sci-fi tech. 

The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, better known as MOXIE, uses a technology called solid oxide electrolysis, and the goal? To produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere for both propellant and breathing. 

NASA is continuing to prepare for human exploration of Mars and is set to launch its next rover to the red planet in 2020. Seven instruments will be aboard the rover, six of which are focused on sample analysis like this SuperCam and a spectrometer called PIXL that’ll measure chemical signatures of Martian rocks. And MOXIE is the seventh. 

We sat down with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Instrument Systems Engineer Asad Aboobaker to find out more about how exactly MOXIE will make oxygen on Mars, check out this Focal Point to find out more.

They are the first of more than 800 adults aged between 18 and 55 who have been recruited for the study.  Half the group will receive the Covid-19 vaccine, and half will get a control vaccine which protects against meningitis. The results won't be known for several months.

Meanwhile the UK government has said that millions of key workers and their families will be eligible for a coronavirus test if they develop symptoms. 

The Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that they would be able to book a test online. More testing centres are being opened and the army will be helping establish mobile testing facilities.

kIID5FDi2JQ,2016-12-02,Why all world maps are wrong,"Making accurate world maps is mathematically impossible.
Follow Johnny on Instagram www.instagram.com/johnny.harris/

Help us make more ambitious videos by joining the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Maps are flat representations of our spherical planet. Johnny Harris cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat.

His struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion.

To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.

For instance, the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries while distorting the size, especially near the north and south pole.

For a more accurate view of land area look at the Gall-Peters projection, which preserves area while distorting shape.

In the end, there's not ""right"" map projection. Each comes with trade-offs, and cartographers make projection decisions based on the particular tasks at hand. But if you are interested in seeing an accurate depiction of the planet, it's best to stick with a globe.

But let's talk a bit more about the astronomical observations that corroborate this theory. Let's look at black holes and the stars that orbit them. Let's look at gravitational lensing, and gravitational waves. These are all incredible phenomena that we can see in telescopes that tell us Einstein was absolutely right when he developed his theory a little bit over a century ago. Take a look!

AcbqB0pFRPA,2019-03-15,Why I’ve Been Injecting Snake Venom for 30 Years,"Steve Ludwin has been voluntarily injecting snake venom for 30 years. This began as a quest for personal immunity, the fountain of youth and the acquiring of serpent powers but became considerably more profound when a laboratory in Copenhagen discovered his masochism. 

Now, his blood is in trials to be potentially used as a worldwide antivenom which could save thousands of lives. In the run up to the release of VICE's new three-part series Snake and Man, Steve breaks down why he started injecting venom, why he looks 20 years younger and how he may have accidentally become an antivenom messiah.

Michio Kaku on what makes a supergenius.

Dr. Michio Kaku explains one theory behind déjà vu and asks, ""Is it ever possible on any scale to perhaps flip between different universes?""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MICHIO KAKU

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel. His radio show broadcasts to 100 radio stations every week. Dr. Kaku holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York (CUNY), where he has taught for over 25 years. He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

Michio Kaku: Déjà vu is a phenomenon that all of us have experienced, that eerie feeling when you walk into a room or enter a new situation and you say to yourself, “I’ve been here before. I mean, everything here is familiar.” 

It turns out that we can actually induce forms of déjà vu in subjects in experiments. So there is a theory that says that déjà vu simply elicits fragments of memories that we have stored in our brain, memories that can be elicited by moving into an environment that resembles something that we’ve already experienced. So we don’t have to invoke parallel universes, we don’t have to invoke the multiverse in order to explain most déjà vu.

However, it does raise the other question: is it ever possible on any scale to perhaps flip between different universes? And the answer there is actually rather unclear.  We physicists believe, for example, that there is really a multiverse that exists even inside our living room.  We are waves, vibrating waves given by the **** function, and these waves vibrate and then split apart with time. 

Steve Weinberg, winner of the Nobel Prize, compares it to the following.  Think of radio.  If you’re inside your living room listening to BBC radio, that radio is tuned to one frequency.  But in your living room there are all frequencies - radio Cuba, radio Moscow, the Top 40 rock stations.  All these radio frequencies are vibrating inside your living room, but your radio is only tuned to one frequency.

Now, in other words when two universes are in phase, they are coherent and you can move back and forth.  But as time starts to evolve, these two universes decouple. They start to vibrate at different frequencies. They can no longer interfere with each other. So why is it that your radio cannot listen to Radio Moscow?  Why isn’t it possible for your radio to listen to all frequencies? Because your radio is decohered.  It is no longer vibrating in unison with these other frequencies.

And the same thing in quantum physics.  We consist of atoms. Our atoms vibrate, but they no longer vibrate in unison with these other universes. We have decoupled from them, we have decohered from them. So in other words, deja vu is probably simply a fragment of our brain eliciting memories and fragments of previous situations. However, in quantum physics, there really are in some sense parallel universes surrounding us, the problem is, we can’t enter them because we have decohered from them. We’re no longer vibrating in unison with them. Sorry about that.",Big Think,UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQECJukTDE2i6aCoMnS-Vg,2701314.0,5425.0,30735.0,180.0,[],"['bigthink', 'physicist', 'Deja', 'Michio Kaku', 'physics', 'michio', 'jonathan fowler', 'Universe', 'déjà vu', 'quantum physics', 'science', 'quantum', 'Scientist', 'universes', '5mins', 'subconcious', 'Elizabeth Rodd', 'memory', 'Big Think', 'kaku', 'Dejavu', 'parallel universe', 'memories', 'BigThink.com', 'michio kaku interview', 'michio kaku big think', 'michio kaku deja vu', 'what is deja vu', 'what causes deja vu', 'what is deja vu and why does it happen', 'deja vu big think', 'deja vu michio kaku', 'deja vu', 'michio kaku physics', 'deja vu explained']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ks_UHmaZcSg/sddefault.jpg,,,yes,,flat earth,pseudoscience,,9

Dr. Kaku addresses the question ""What if Einstein's theory of relativity is wrong?""
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MICHIO KAKU:

Dr. Michio Kaku is the co-founder of string field theory, and is one of the most widely recognized scientists in the world today. He has written 4 New York Times Best Sellers, is the science correspondent for CBS This Morning and has hosted numerous science specials for BBC-TV, the Discovery/Science Channel.

He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, as well as New York University (NYU). 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TRANSCRIPT:

Michio Kaku: Many physicists had a heart attack when we got news from Geneva, Switzerland that Einstein might be wrong.  All hell broke loose in the physics community.  Every physicist I know was taking a position on this hot topic because relativity is the foundation of modern physics along with the Quantum Theory.  

Now what they found was if you take a beam of neutrinos from the atom smasher in Geneva, Switzerland, shoot the beam through the mountains from Switzerland to Italy over a distance of 454 miles, the neutrinos out-raced a light beam by a distance of 60 feet, 60 feet over a distance of 454 miles.  Well, that doesn’t sound like much, but to a physicist this is a disaster.  It means that the foundations of modern physics have to be called into question.
First, it means that time travel could become commonplace because as you approach the speed of light time slows down.  If you exceed the speed of light, time goes backwards.  Remember that scene in Superman One when Lois Lane dies and Superman goes into outer space and goes around the planet earth in the opposite direction; the earth stops and then rotates in the opposite direction and then, all of the sudden, Lois Lane springs back to life?  Well, that kind of scenario might be possible if the speed of light is not so special that particles can exceed the speed of light, not to mention that we’ll have to recalibrate everything - the age of the universe, the age of stars, the distance to the stars, the basic structure of modern electronics has to be changed, the GPS, nuclear weapons, all of that would have to be recalibrated and rethought through if Einstein’s theory of relativity is wrong.

So what’s the solution to the problem?  Well the solution to the problem is obviously they goofed.  They made a mistake.  I remember when I was a grad student years and years ago at Harvard.  My advisor at Harvard was Professor Pound and he the famous Pound-Rebka Experiment where they shot a light beam from the top of Jefferson Hall to the bottom of Jefferson Hall.  Now, there was a rival group, a rival group that also did the same experiment and they had to calculate the speed of light in the process.  They found that the speed of light actually rose in the morning, peaked at noontime.  Then the speed of light began to slow down at dinnertime and reached a minimum at midnight.  Well, this was shocking.  The speed of light, which governs the universe all of the sudden is wedded to lunchtime and dinnertime. So what's the problem?  The problem was that this counter experiment, this rival experiment, was done outdoors, and the sensors were temperature-dependent, and of course it’s warmer at lunchtime and colder at midnight.  Well, Professor Pound’s experiment was done indoors and therefore, didn’t have that kind of variation.  
The lesson here is: systematic errors creep into very delicate calculations.  Some people think they found the source of the error.  How do we know that from Switzerland to Italy the distance is 454 miles?  Well, you use GPS, right? Obvious, but GPS is a relativistic system.  It uses relativity and some physicists have claimed that they mis-calibrated the distance from the sensors to the satellite and satellite back down to Italy, a triangle; that one of the lengths of the triangle was mis-calibrated in the process of doing this experiment. 

Now, there is another counter example.  Back in 1987, light from a gigantic supernova in the Magellanic Clouds hit the planet earth and, simultaneously with that, neutrinos were detected in gigantic neutrino detectors in Japan.

If advanced alien civilizations do exist, theoretical physicist Michio Kaku asks, why would they want anything to do with us? It would be like an academic talking to a squirrel, he suggests, and he has a great point. Hollywood and science fiction novels have conditioned us for years to believe that aliens either want to hang out on our intellectual level and learn from us... or destroy us. If alien life really does have the technology and know-how to make it all the way here, perhaps we should just play it cool and not assume that we are the top species in the universe. Besides, if we play our cards wrong and go all Will Smith in Independence Day on our smart new neighbors, it could be the end of us. Mankind's biggest folly, Kaku suggests, might just be in its insistence that we are an exceptional species. Michio Kaku's latest book is the wonderful and enlightening The Future of Humanity: Terraforming Mars, Interstellar Travel, Immortality, and Our Destiny Beyond Earth.

TRANSCRIPT:

Michio Kaku: We have this mental image that a flying saucer will circle the White House lawn, land on the White House lawn and give us a bounty of all sorts of technological goodies to initiate an age of Aquarius on the planet earth. Personally, I don’t think that’s going to happen. For example, if you’re in the forest do you go out and talk to the squirrels and the deer? Maybe you do for a while, but after a while, you get bored because they don’t talk back to you because they have nothing interesting to tell you because they can’t relate to our values and our ideas. If you go down to an anthill do you go down to the ants and say I bring you trinkets; I bring you bees; take me to your aunt queen; I give you nuclear energy. So I think for the most part the aliens are probably not going to be interested in us because we’re so arrogant to believe that we have something to offer them. Realize that they could be thousands, maybe millions of years ahead of us in technology and they may have no interest in interacting with us in the same way that we don’t necessarily want to deal with the squirrels and the deer in the forest.

Now some people say that we should not try to make contact with them because they could be potentially dangerous. For the most part, I think they’re going to be peaceful because they’ll be thousands of years ahead of us, but we cannot take the chance. So I personally believe that we should not try to advertise our existence to alien life in outer space because of the fact that we don’t know their intentions.

Then the other question is what happens if they’re evil? Well, I think the question of evil is actually a relative question because the real danger to a deer in the forest is not the hunter with a gigantic rifle; he’s not the main danger to a deer in the forest. The main danger to a deer in the forest is the developer; the guy with blueprints; the guy in a three-piece suit; the guy with a slide rule and calculator; the guy that’s going to pave the forest and perhaps destroy whole ecosystems.

In other words, the aliens don’t have to be evil in order to be dangerous to us, they might not care, they just might not care about us and in the process pave us over. In fact, if you read the novel War of the Worlds the Martians in HG Wells seminal novel were not evil in the sense they wanted to torture us and they wanted to do all sorts of barbaric things to humanity. No, we were just in the way. And so I think that is a potential problem. We could be in the way of a very advanced civilization that simply is not evil but simply views us as we would view squirrels and deer in the forest. So personally I think that we should not advertise our existence when we go into outer spac...

OVERVIEW
In this Big Think video, Dr. Michio Kaku explains why he believes in a universal intelligence and describes ""God"" as a mathematician and as “cosmic music.”  “I have concluded that we are in a world made by rules created by an intelligence,” Kaku says. “To me it is clear that we exist in a plan which is governed by rules that were created, shaped by a universal intelligence and not by chance.”  “The final solution resolution could be that god is a mathematician,” says Kaku. “The mind of god, we believe, is cosmic music. The music of strings resonating through 11-dimensional hyperspace.”

He has also been a visiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study as well as New York University (NYU).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Michio Kaku: Some people ask the question of what good is math?  What is the relationship between math and physics?  Well, sometimes math leads.  Sometimes physics leads.  Sometimes they come together because, of course, there’s a use for the mathematics.  For example, in the 1600s Isaac Newton asked a simple question: if an apple falls then does the moon also fall?  That is perhaps one of the greatest questions ever asked by a member of Homo sapiens since the six million years since we parted ways with the apes.  If an apple falls, does the moon also fall? 

Isaac Newton said yes, the moon falls because of the Inverse Square Law.  So does an apple.  He had a unified theory of the heavens, but he didn't have the mathematics to solve the falling moon problem.  So what did he do?  He invented calculus.  So calculus is a direct consequence of solving the falling moon problem.  In fact, when you learn calculus for the first time, what is the first thing you do?  The first thing you do with calculus is you calculate the motion of falling bodies, which is exactly how Newton calculated the falling moon, which opened up celestial mechanics.

So here is a situation where math and physics were almost conjoined like Siamese twins, born together for a very practical question, how do you calculate the motion of celestial bodies?  Then here comes Einstein asking a different question and that is, what is the nature and origin of gravity?  Einstein said that gravity is nothing but the byproduct of curved space.  So why am I sitting in this chair?  A normal person would say I'm sitting in this chair because gravity pulls me to the ground, but Einstein said no, no, no, there is no such thing as gravitational pull; the earth has curved the space over my head and around my body, so space is pushing me into my chair.  So to summarize Einstein's theory, gravity does not pull; space pushes.  But, you see, the pushing of the fabric of space and time requires differential calculus.  That is the language of curved surfaces, differential calculus, which you learn in fourth year calculus.

So again, here is a situation where math and physics were very closely combined, but this time math came first.  The theory of curved surfaces came first.  Einstein took that theory of curved surfaces and then imported it into physics.

Now we have string theory.  It turns out that 100 years ago math and physics parted ways.  In fact, when Einstein proposed special relativity in 1905, that was also around the time of the birth of topology, the topology of hyper-dimensional objects, spheres in 10, 11, 12, 26, whatever dimension you want, so physics and mathematics parted ways.  Math went into hyperspace and mathematicians said to themselves, aha, finally we have found an area of mathematics that has no physical application whatsoever.  Mathematicians pride themselves on being useless.  They love being useless.  It's a badge of courage being useless, and they said the most useless thing of all is a theory of differential topology and higher dimensions.

Well, physics plotted along for many decades.  We worked out atomic bombs.

Look up—you can see the greatest feat of human cooperation orbiting 254 miles above Earth. As commander of Expedition 35 aboard the International Space Station (ISS), Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield understands the difficulty of cultural barriers in team work, and the life or death necessity of learning to communicate across those divides. The ISS is a joint project between five space agencies, built by people from 15 different nations—and each of them has a different take on what is ""normal"". Hadfield explains the scale of cultural differences aboard the spaceship: ""What do you do on a Friday night? What does ""yes"" mean? What does ""uh-huh"" mean? What is the day of worship? When do you celebrate a holiday? How do you treat your spouse or your children? How do you treat each other? What is the hierarchy of command? All of those things seem completely clear to you, but you were raised in a specific culture that is actually shared by no one else."" Here, Hadfield explains his strategy for genuine listening and communication. Whether it's money, reputation, or your life that's at stake, being sensitive and aware of people's differences helps you accomplish something together—no matter where you’re from. Amway believes that ​diversity and inclusion ​are ​essential ​to the ​growth ​and ​prosperity ​of ​today’s ​companies. When woven ​into ​every ​aspect ​of ​the talent ​life ​cycle, companies committed to diversity and inclusion are ​the ​best ​equipped ​to ​innovate, ​improve ​brand image ​and ​drive ​performance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHRIS HADFIELD :

“Good morning, Earth.” That is how Colonel Chris Hadfield—writing on Twitter—woke up the world every day while living aboard the International Space Station for over five months. Since blasting off from Kazakhstan in December 2012, Hadfield has become a worldwide sensation, harnessing the power of social media to make outer space accessible to millions and infusing a sense of wonder into the collective consciousness not felt since man first walked on the moon. Called “the most famous astronaut since Neil Armstrong” by the BBC, Hadfield, now safely back on Earth, continues to bring the glory of science and space travel to everyone he encounters.

Hadfield is the pioneer of many firsts. In 1992, he was selected by the Canadian Space Agency as a NASA Mission Specialist – Canada’s first fully-qualified Space Shuttle crewmember. Three years later, he was the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in space, and the first Canadian to board a Russian spacecraft as he helped build the Russian space station ‘Mir’. In 2001, he performed two spacewalks - the first Canadian to do so - and in 2010 the CSA and NASA announced Hadfield’s third mission: commanding the International Space Station (ISS)—again a first for a Canadian.

Hadfield launched into space on December 19, 2012 and took command of the ISS in March. His multiple daily Tweets and photographs from space made people see the world differently. His accessibility, whether answering questions such as, “How do you wring out a washcloth in space,” via Skype or collaborating with The Barenaked Ladies for a song sung by nearly a million people simultaneously, endeared him to all while he orbited Earth. 

A heavily decorated astronaut, engineer, and pilot, Hadfield’s many awards include receiving the Order of Ontario, the Meritorious Service Cross, and the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He was named the top Test Pilot in both the US Air Force and the US Navy, and has been inducted into Canada’s Aviation Hall of Fame. He is also commemorated on Canadian postage stamps, Royal Canadian Mint silver and gold coins, and on Canada’s new 5 dollar bill.

Chris Hadfield: High above our heads is the International Space Station. It’s an amazing, complex thing—the most complicated thing we’ve ever built in space, one of the most complex international projects ever conceived and ever completed. But the keyword of that is international. It is a place built by people from all around the planet, 15 different countries.

And that just sounds sort of theoretical, until you start thinking: different languages, different units measureme...

3y0nHhFGXDo,2015-08-23,Balloon with GoPro to Near Space,"MAKE SURE TO WATCH IN HD! 
High altitude unmanned balloon launch that goes up to near space and back. 
HOW I GOT THE FOOTAGE BACK:
I used a SPOT GPS tracker in the payload to track where the payload fell after the balloon burst. Then I retrieved it with the GoPro and its recorded footage inside. See links below for much more details. 

Yes, it’s a GoPro, yes they have a built in semi fish eye lens. Think what you want, I did this for my own enjoyment, not to prove any point. 

Two posts I've made that can answer many of the questions in the comments: 
Post on the launch: https://imgur.com/gallery/UXezC
Post of How to do your own Balloon Launch: https://imgur.com/gallery/8a40L

All designed and launched by myself. All FAA regulations were followed, the FSDO was notified and given all the details, and a NOTAM was even filed with Ft Worth center for balloon activity. 

A lot of people asked me why I was doing this. Mostly, I had free time and needed a project/hobby to keep me engaged and secondly, space is neat. Check out the video and see for yourself.

The Coin in the video is from my AFROTC detachment at Purdue University. Go Boilers! Shout out to Purdue Engineering for teaching me how to tackle a project like this.

FdZh1P57b1k,2020-01-19,Why SpaceX Blew Up A Falcon 9 Rocket On Purpose,"SpaceX and NASA on January 19 purposefully blew up a Falcon 9 rocket. The ""in-flight abort"" test was meant to assess the Crew Dragon escape system. The Crew Dragon is a spacecraft attached to the Falcon 9 that is designed to take human passengers to space. The planned explosion can be tied to the Apollo 1 accident in which three astronauts died during a preflight test. Some experts believe that the space race pressured NASA into cutting corners at the expense of safety while testing Apollo 1. This led to stricter regulations for space missions that still apply today.

Peel off your tin-foil hat like a Hershey’s Kiss, because Bill Nye has a reality check for the alien conspiracists out there. Roswell? Area 51? Vincent D'Onofrio as the roach alien in MIB? Bill Nye shoos them away, deeming each as unrealistic as the next.

BILL NYE:
Bill Nye, scientist, engineer, comedian, author, and inventor, is a man with a mission: to help foster a scientifically literate society, to help people everywhere understand and appreciate the science that makes our world work. Making science entertaining and accessible is something Bill has been doing most of his life.
 In Seattle Nye began to combine his love of science with his flair for comedy, when he won the Steve Martin look-alike contest and developed dual careers as an engineer by day and a stand-up comic by night. Nye then quit his day engineering day job and made the transition to a night job as a comedy writer and performer on Seattle’s home-grown ensemble comedy show “Almost Live.” This is where “Bill Nye the Science Guy®” was born. The show appeared before Saturday Night Live and later on Comedy Central, originating at KING-TV, Seattle’s NBC affiliate. 
 While working on the Science Guy show, Nye won seven national Emmy Awards for writing, performing, and producing. The show won 18 Emmys in five years. In between creating the shows, he wrote five children’s books about science, including his latest title, “Bill Nye’s Great Big Book of Tiny Germs.”
 Nye is the host of three currently-running television series. “The 100 Greatest Discoveries” airs on the Science Channel. “The Eyes of Nye” airs on PBS stations across the country.
 Bill’s latest project is hosting a show on Planet Green called “Stuff Happens.” It’s about environmentally responsible choices that consumers can make as they go about their day and their shopping. Also, you’ll see Nye in his good-natured rivalry with his neighbor Ed Begley. They compete to see who can save the most energy and produce the smallest carbon footprint. Nye has 4,000 watts of solar power and a solar-boosted hot water system. There’s also the low water use garden and underground watering system. It’s fun for him; he’s an engineer with an energy conservation hobby.
 Nye is currently the Executive Director of The Planetary Society, the world’s largest space interest organization.

TRANSCRIPT:
Question: Hey Bill. So there are many videos online claiming to be extraterrestrial sightings. It just seems that the government is aware of extraterrestrials yet they reject the idea. Possibly they’re hiding the truth from us in fear of the knowledge greatly changing our daily lives. Do you believe these aliens exist and if so would you tell us?
Bill Nye: No I don’t believe the aliens exist coming to visit you and the government knows about it and hasn’t told you. No. Start with that. Two more things. First of all the whole alien thing really got revved up in 1947. There was a project called Sky Hook and the U.S. Government had these very cool super high altitude balloons and they were going to have a constellation of them or an armada of these balloons off the East Coast of the former Soviet Union with microphones tuned to listen for nuclear weapons tests. This was going to be big fun. And so they were testing the balloon in New Mexico and it was complicated and the winds blew the thing around and it crashed and it was impractical. The idea was kind of cool but it was a cold war idea that just didn’t work. Now this project was secret so yes, government people showed up. The U.S. Army swept up all the debris from the crash and took it away because it was secret.
And they also experimented with parachuting dummies from very high altitudes in the same area. And this has led to all these fabulous myths about aliens and the government knows stuff you don’t. Now I look like nobody and I am but I had an engineering job, several of them over the years, and during one of them I had security clearance. And I worked on a secret airplane for a little while and I never went myself but I worked with several guys, they were all men, who went to Area 51 to Groom Lake which is an Air Force base in Nevada where we fly around these secret airplanes. And it’s a real place. And these guys went there and when I was doing it it was called level five security clearance. I only had level four. I never went to Groom Lake. But t...

To kick off the year, here the first version of the Vortex.
It took way more effort than I expected. Mostly because I realized that VR and within a frame are different presentation approaches. But I think found solutions for almost everything.
So, this is my attempt to redefine Size Comparisons on YouTube again.
Hope you like it.

1xwmqEUMWRI,2017-12-01,What If The Earth Were Flat?,"Today, it's nearly impossible to believe the Earth is anything but round. But for most of our history, humans have thought Earth was flat.

The one concept our ancient ancestors were missing was gravity. Gravity's effects are the key to determining whether the Earth is actually flat, or not.

On a sphere, gravity pulls in the same direction everywhere on the surface. But on a disc, gravity changes direction as you move toward the edge.

At the center, you feel a downward pull just like on spherical Earth. But as you move out, gravity starts pulling sideways as well as a downwards.

This would wreak havoc on sports played in different parts of the world. A ball thrown straight up in the air mid-way out, would curve down and backward toward the disc's center. Plus, a ball thrown mid-way out wouldn't go nearly as high or far as a ball thrown up at the edge where gravity's downward pull is practically zero.

But sports are just the beginning. Since plant stems grow opposite to the direction of gravity, an effect called negative gravitropism, you'll see forests grow at an increasingly sharp angle the farther you are from the center.

Continue toward the edge and you feel like you're climbing a hill that's growing steeper with each step as the backward pull of gravity takes over. At Earth’s end, that hill will feel like a 90-degree cliff, pulling you back to the center. But if you could make it over the edge, and stand on the thin outer part of the disc, you'll feel downward pull just like on spherical Earth.

However, living here would be like living in a desert. Gravity's backward effects pull on the oceans too, making it impossible for any water to reach the edge. Instead, sea levels will gradually rise as you travel in, making the world's center an aquatic metropolis.

So, the next time you see an apple fall straight to the ground, thank your lucky stars that Earth is round. Because if it were flat, that apple might actually hit you in the face.

OmYWy-sKFcA,2019-06-14,This is NOT Black Hole! [Urdu/Hindi],"This Video explains why the image released by Event Horizon telescope is not a ""Photo"" and the object in the image is not Black hole (Entirely) this video explains what is the difference between Image and a Photo and then I moved forward explaining the challenges during the processing image of the black hole, this video includes all the links of presentations by National Science Foundation and related personell like Katie Bouman Interview and Veritasium videos. 

Then its further explained that Black hole itself is in the ring and can not be seen by telescope as it captures all the light, but we only see Event Horizon along with Shadow of Black hole to appreciate the picture. 

Without a doubt this is really one of the best evidence science has for Black hole and the entire team of scientist deserve credit

The reason of this video is to clarify how things are, and show a bit clearer picture!

OTSXGyGhrPo,2016-08-31,Simple DIY Round Earth Experiments,"Have you been asked to research the flat earth? Is there proof which you can do to see if the Earth is round? Recently, I have been getting a lot of comments on my channel from flat earthers saying the Earth can't be round. This got me wondering how exactly we know the Earth is round, excluding space agencies imagery. The result is this video. In my mind's eye this is conclusive proof. I really tried to do this from an unbiased perspective as I didn't want to bash on any group of people. I spent a long time researching and producing this so I hope you liked it!

We journey to see what amount of quantity for the all the people on earth, all the ants on earth, all the atoms in your body, all the stars in the universe and beyond. Every single mind-blown number you can think of, going bigger than infinity... this gets even more extreme!

Kindly note several errors in the video (thanks to our viewers for spotting them): 
69 should be the number of companies exceeding USD $100 BILLION as opposed to million. 
172,000 is the usable words in Oxford Dictionary, the actual number is likely close to a 300K. 
The number of data bytes ever created should be 10^22 instead of 10^20. The figure for 10^20 is outdated. 
The number presented is not a Googolplex to the power of a Googolplex but rather 10^10^(100*(10^10^100)). Likewise for the Googolplex 3 times. 
The figures for the number of games are the lower bound, as opposed to the total number of games. 
The largest prime given should be the largest KNOWN prime found as of 2019. 
The simplified version of infinities are incorrectly described. The ordinals should be ω•2, ω•3... instead of 2ω, 3ω...
The infinity symbol for inaccessible infinity is denoted as I instead of ε0, where ε0 refers to inaccessible from ω^ω...
The infinity symbol for indescribable infinity is denoted as Πn_m instead of ζ0.
The correct order would be ω, ω+1..., ω•2..., ω^ω...,ε0..., ζ0..., Γ...,ω_1...
A rectified version incorporating different elements and items will be coming soon...

Obviously not all, only some more prominent. Some buildings have been left out because they are impossible to measure, or because they are in real life.

Recently I went to a Tony Robbins event, Unleash The Power Within (UPW).  There was blood, sweat, tears, and of course Tony Robbins.  Aside from almost dying from aliveness, I came away enlightened about how to unleash my inner power onto the outer world.  The only thing more powerful than my Tony Robbins event experience is the fact that I documented it.  This video will help you unleash your power.

7aVFYjy1wWM,2012-08-03,"Thomas Dolby Live - ""The Flat Earth"" @ Largo, 2012","This is one of a series of songs recorded live (and low-tech!) during Thomas Dolby's Spring 2012 Time Capsule Tour.

Comments from Thomas Dolby (vocals, keyboards):
I start this with a loop I made years ago with a Roland JP8. It always reminds me of the Masai Mara in Kenya. I add a bass, which gets looped into Logic, and then a marimba pattern. The choruses are played on a Logic ES2 through a plugin called Camelspace, which 'gates' the chords—basically, it opens and closes them in time to the tempo of the song, so all I have to do is hold down the chord and they play a repeating rhythm.

In the bridge I trigger samples of Martin Luther King, somewhat slowed and truncated. You've heard this speech a thousand times before, but it's still pretty evocative.

Comments from Kevin Armstrong (guitar):
I love this tune.  At 1:29 I have to play those little highlife African riffs that were really influenced by listening to Fela Kuti, The Bhundu Bays and Thomas Mapfumo. I have to sing a bass counter melody at the same time and this is extraordinarily hard to do. It's like splitting your brain in half. My hands are trying to dance over those figures in C# high up on the guitar and I'm trying to sing those low notes in tune slow and steady. I'm still working on it and I must have done it a thousand times.

Comments from Mat Hector (drums):
What a beautiful tune. I love this track. It's a joy to just sit on the groove and listen; as the drummer I have the best seat in the house. For drums this track is all about creating the drum machine vibe, specifically the 808 drum machine which was used on the original recording. As you can see from the video I'm triggering 808 samples from my 2box drum brain via the Roland spd-30 sample pad (that's the thing I'm hitting!) so it's the actual drum sounds from the original track that you're hearing. For me it's all about locking with the sequence bass and playing as consistently as possible, trying to replicate the machine like groove of the drum machine. 

The two notable points for me on this tune is firstly the use of something that can be considered corny sometimes - the bell tree. At 3:48, as the Martin Luther king sample talks about the daybreak, I trigger a bell tree sample - on this occasion perfect and apt. The second point of interest is as the song nears the end you'll notice me starting to embellish the groove with the side stick sample - this is to give the groove and song a little more movement in line with the sequenced bass (being careful to do this in between the vocal rather than over it) - building to the gentle crescendo as the groove drops out and the song ends.",thetimecapsuletv,UCtwk4qMZMoxbRBIR5ErcOIw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtwk4qMZMoxbRBIR5ErcOIw,37313.0,62.0,424.0,351.0,[],"['Largo', 'Music', 'Thomas', 'Dolby', 'The', 'Flat', 'Earth']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7aVFYjy1wWM/sddefault.jpg,,,,,flat earth,pseudoscience,pseudoscience,67

As a big fan of the Portal series, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to make a video on these investment opportunities (pun intended). This was an interesting source to work with and I greatly enjoyed making this project. As usual, I hope you enjoy. Comments and feedback are welcome. Thank you for watching and stay tuned for more :)

Just an update, things are finalising and I will be moving house soon, and then going on a holiday for a few weeks. While I am working on videos when I can, I expect delays in uploading, or minimal activity on the channel over May and June (although I appear to be taking my sweet time already). I'm sorry about that, but that is life.
Up next, a short Spider-Man video. I'm also working on a big Star Wars project, so expect something in the near future.

lPNrtjboISg,2016-08-12,How the World Map Looks Wildly Different Than You Think,"All of us have seen a world map at some point in our lives before, but it is very difficult to imagine how certain countries and parts of the world compare to each other in size that are far apart. In this video, I explore why the world looks very different than how it is portrayed in the Mercator Projection map. I then go on to explore how certain countries are unexpectedly larger or smaller than what they appear to be, and how some places looks wildly different than our perceptions.

PS; Don't totally hate on the Mercator Projection, it's actually a really useful map for navigation and on keeping the correct shape of countries while sacrificing the size that we can all laugh about!

In real time, the magnetic poles switch places every 250,000 years. Yep, North becomes South, and South is the new North – magnetically, at least! But on this 1-day-old planet, they’re changing 12 times a second!

Also, the continents move about 1 inch per year to form a supercontinent. That happens every 400 million years. But today, they’re merging and breaking up every 2 hours! And you know what? Out of an entire 24-hour day, our species only showed up right at the last minute!

SUMMARY:
- At around 12:00am, the young Earth collides with another planet called Theia. Will you look at that – the moon is born! 
- At 5:30am, we see the first single-celled organisms starting their life in the ocean. 
- By 11am, photosynthesizing bacteria have managed to take in enough sun for the past 6 “hours” (aka, a billion years) to fill the atmosphere with the byproduct they let out: oxygen!
- At 11:35, it starts to get chilly. A mere second later, it’s freezing cold, and we have the first snowball on Earth.
- At 7:20pm, we FINALLY have something familiar: sponges!
- It’s 7:55, and the Earth freezes over again. Time for a 2-minute ski sesh before everything melts.
- At around 8:30, we can remove our sun-protecting gear because now the Ozone layer appears. 
- By 8:45, life is flourishing in the sea. We now have jellyfish swimming around corals. 
- It’s 9:10pm, the moon is up, the sea creatures are getting a little stir-crazy, so they decide to explore the land. 
- By 9:45, we have the first 4-legged animals appearing in shallow waters. 
- By 10:30, everything vanishes, we can hardly see any animals. A mass extinction takes place. Only 5% of the species survive. I’m not sure what caused it. 
- 10:34, and the moment is here. The dinosaurs are finally making an appearance. The first one was the Nyasasaurus.
- 10:45 marks another mass extinction. Boy, it’s the second one in an hour. But thankfully, our dinosaur friends make it. 
- It’s 11:03, and we have the first kangaroo ancestors. These are the first animals that carry their babies in a pouch. 
- By 11:17, dinosaurs are reaching their full size. It’s like Jurassic Park around here! Look at the Argentinosaurus. This guy was the largest animal that ever existed.
- It’s 11:26. A giant asteroid coming right our way! It smashes into the Earth, and dust flies everywhere. A few seconds later, everything clears up, but the dinosaurs have disappeared.
- It’s 11:58pm, and still no signs of people. But the chimpanzees and bonobos appear suddenly!
- It’s 11:59 and 23 seconds, and we FINALLY have full-blown humans over in Africa! A second later, they start migrating all over the world.

Now we're so close to the giant planet that it's the only thing that fills our sky. Ground temperatures on Earth are rising uncontrollably, our atmosphere is igniting into flames, and the scientific community is scrambling to provide answers.

Lyrics:
I moved out to Langely recently
with a plain and simple dream;
wanna infiltrate some third-world place
and topple their regime.
their men in black with their matching suitcases;
where everything's on a need-to-know basis;
agents got that swagger;
everyone so cloak and dagger.
i'm feelin' nervous but i'm really kinda wishing
for another undercover mission
that's when the red alert came on the radio
and i put my earpiece on!
got my dark sunglasses on!
and i had my weapon drawn!
so i get my handcuffs,
my cyanide pills,
my classified dossier!
tappin' the phones like yeah, shreddin' the files like yeah,
and then i memorised all the enemy spies i've gotta neutralize today.
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
i've done a couple of crazy things that have almost got me dismissed,
like terminate some head of state who wasn't even on my list.
burn that microfilm buddy, will you,
i'd tell you why but then i'd have to kill you!
you need a quickie confession?
we'll start a waterboarding session!
no hurry on this south american dictator
i'll assassinate him later
that's when he walked right in my laser sights,
and my silencer was on,
and my silencer was on,
and another target's gone!
yeah, we've got our black ops all over the world, from Kazakhstan to Bombay;
payin' the bribes like yeah, pluggin' the leaks like yeah;
interrogating the scum of the earth, we'll break them by the break of day!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
need a country destabilized?
look no further, we're your guys!
we've got snazzy suits and ties,
and a better dental plan than the fbi's!
better put your hands up and get in the van,
or else you'll get blown away!
stagin' a coup like yeah,
brainwashin' moles like yeah,
we only torture the folks we don't like,
you're probably going to be ok!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!
yeeeaaahhh, it's a party in the cia!

iphcyNWFD10,2017-01-05,The Absurdity of Detecting Gravitational Waves,"A head-vaporizing laser with a perfect wavelength detecting sub-proton space-time ripples.
Huge thanks to Prof Rana Adhikari and LIGO: http://ligo.org
Here's how he felt when he learned about the first ever detection: https://youtu.be/ViMnGgn87dg

Thanks to Patreon supporters:

A lot of videos have covered the general overview of the discovery of gravitational waves, what they are, the history of the search, when they were found but I wanted to delve into the absurd science that made the detection possible.

When scientists want one megawatt of laser power, it's not just for fun (though I'm sure it's that too), it's because the fluctuations in the number of photons is proportional to their square root, making more powerful beams less noisy (as a fraction of their total). The smoothest mirrors were created not for aesthetic joy but because when you're trying to measure wiggles that are a fraction the width of a proton, a rough mirror surface simply won't do.

In November, 1884, the New York Times ran a pretty interesting story. An astronomer, known only by the name, “Arndt” claimed to have discovered a cubic planet, just beyond the orbit of Neptune. Less than 100 years later, another discovery was made. This time, by a man who not only named the planet, but who also had maps, and sketches of its alien life forms.

How long would it take? Years? Centuries? Millennia? Would there be any life left on Earth when the pumping was over? What if it happened overnight?

Oceanic water makes up 70% of the Earth’s surface. If we opened a portal about the size of a basketball court, it would take us hundreds of thousands of years to pump out the oceans. They hold over a billion cubic km (321 million cubic miles) of water. But what if we had a pump powerful enough to drain all the oceans in a minute? What would happen then?

That star at the center of our Solar System, that superhot ball of plasma that gives us heat and energy, and amazing complexions...well, it's a ticking time bomb. The Sun is about 10 billion years old. But it's only expected to last about another 5 billion years.  After that, the Sun will expand, becoming a red giant. Then it will shrink to become a white dwarf, a dying star, cooling for the next several billion years. Of course, we'll all be long gone before any of that happens. But still, can you imagine what it would be like to watch the Sun blow up before your very eyes?

lNi5UFpales,2014-04-08,NASA | Understanding Lunar Eclipses,"It's not often that we get a chance to see our planet's shadow, but a lunar eclipse gives us a fleeting glimpse. During these rare events, the full Moon rapidly darkens and then glows red as it enters the Earth's shadow. Though a lunar eclipse can be seen only at night, it's worth staying up to catch the show.  The next lunar eclipse visible from the western hemisphere will take place in the early morning hours of April 15, 2014, from about 2:00 am - 5:30 am Eastern Daylight Time (EDT).

uzorkQxyc-g,2018-07-26,Why The Moon Turns Red During A Total Lunar Eclipse,"If the moon is in Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, how can we still see it? And why does it turn red? The answer has to do with our own terrestrial sunrises and sunsets.

--------------------------------------------------

Following is the transcript of the video:

Narrator: A blood moon lunar eclipse wasn't always something to look forward to. When the moon turned red thousands of year ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared that something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts. And since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, when the moon returns to normal afterward, they were probably convinced that their whooping and howling actually worked. We know now that the moon doesn't need our protection. But why does it turn red in the first place?

Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface. So if something were to block that sunlight, say the earth, then, in theory, the moon should disappear from view. But during a total lunar eclipse, when the moon passes through the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface.

This is a NASA simulation of what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that ring is either a sunrise or a sunset. And while it's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's atmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of light around the planet. So that redness you see during a blood moon eclipse is a combination of light from every sunrise and sunset on earth, all happening at once. So, the moon appears red for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red, because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh Scattering, named after the British physicist John William Strutt, also known as Lord Rayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different colors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere.

Look at the sky during daytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter blue light more easily than red. But during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through more of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye, which has two consequences. First, it means more overall sunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily gaze upon the sun at sunset, compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the redder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels through a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So, rather than fear a blood moon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think of it as a romantic moment. After all, it's the only time when you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously.",Tech Insider,UCVLZmDKeT-mV4H3ToYXIFYg,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVLZmDKeT-mV4H3ToYXIFYg,735262.0,1139.0,8899.0,188.0,[],"['Tech Insider', 'TI', 'Tech', 'Science', 'Innovation', 'Digital culture', 'NASA', 'Blood moon', 'lunar eclipse', 'Earth', 'Moon', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset', 'blood moon lunar eclipse', 'Space', 'Planets', 'Planetary science']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uzorkQxyc-g/sddefault.jpg,,,yes,,flat earth,science,,28

6ANfAR2Kjow,2019-01-09,Start A New Life Free Of Liberals With “Conservative Move”,"You can’t pick your family, but you can pick your friends. And if they start to vote differently than you, some families are willing to pick up, leave and find new friends. Sick of states that permit legal marijuana? Same-sex marriages? Laws that permit transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice? What if there were a better way?

Last year, VICE News went to McKinney, Texas to check out ""Conservative ""Move"" - a real estate company that says it has the solution to living a life free of liberals. They’ll try to find you a place to live, a job with a decent wage, and the best schools for your children, in Texas or any other Republican stronghold.

Fx-KrvuiafE,2017-06-21,Decoding the ancient astronomy of Stonehenge,"The solstice alignments of Stonehenge, explained.

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://www.vox.com/join
Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Note: A previous version of this video referred imprecisely to ""Neolithic Britain"" when discussing the Newgrange tomb in Ireland. We have removed that phrasing. My apologies to the Irish.

Stonehenge is a popular destination for summer solstice celebrations because the 5,000-year-old monument points toward the summer solstice sunrise on the horizon. However, it also points to the winter solstice sunset in the opposite direction and there's good reason to believe that this may have been the more important alignment for the Neolithic people who built Stonehenge. 

We investigate by constructing a tiny model of the Stonehenge monument.

vczzNIFMUjE,2020-02-09,Doctor Reacts to Reckless Medical Memes #11,"If you want more MEME REVIEW click HERE: https://bit.ly/2NhCoWf

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review/Responding to comments Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/questions you'd like for me to watch/answer. Love you all!

oBSandHijDc,2015-03-10,Learning from smallpox: How to eradicate a disease - Julie Garon and Walter A. Orenstein,"Find out how smallpox became the first (and only) disease to be permanently eradicated through the use of vaccination and isolation to prevent transmission.

--

For most of human history, we have sought to treat and cure diseases. But only in recent decades did it become possible to ensure that a particular disease never threatens humanity again. Julie Garon and Walter A. Orenstein detail how the story of smallpox – the first and only disease to be permanently eliminated – shows how disease eradication can happen, and why it is so difficult to achieve.

xuiDuoRJkOY,2019-11-27,How America fails its whistleblowers,"Whistleblowers who work with classified information have a few options. All of them are bad.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

“Whistleblowing” is when someone exposes a secret in their organization. And in the US, it’s often hailed as a heroic act. But within the government, whistleblowing is often perilous—especially when it involves classified information.

If a whistleblower goes to the media with classified information, that’s illegal. And since the Obama administration, it’s become common for the government to prosecute people who do it by charging them under a law from 1917 that was originally intended to prosecute spies for helping foreign governments. If a whistleblower files a complaint through internal channels instead, the complaint has to go through the head of the intelligence community before it can see the light of day—and after that, there are few protections against disclosing the whistleblower’s identity, and only weak recourses against retaliation. 

In August 2019, a CIA officer filed a complaint about an alleged quid pro quo between President Trump and the President of Ukraine. The complaint made it to Congress, and kicked off impeachment proceedings. But the existing laws don’t guarantee that this whistleblower will be protected, either.

xZ3RbDTc_fY,2019-09-06,Bart Baker Quit YouTube — Now He’s Trying To Get Big on the Chinese Internet,"Bart Baker, former YouTube celebrity, starts off most mornings by screaming in mangled Chinese.

For the past few years, Bart’s bread and butter was edgy parody music videos, mocking stars like Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. Good videos easily racked in tens of millions of views; a million views was a dud.

But when YouTube started de-prioritizing vulgar videos in order to keep family-friendly advertisers happy, Bart’s income took a massive plunge.

So when he got a mysterious email from a company promising to catapult him to stardom in China, he figured he’d give it a shot. A few videos later, he had millions of followers, in a country he’d never even visited.

Now, Bart’s days start with live chat and song sessions with his millions of Chinese followers on Kwai, a Chinese social media app. Then, his Chinese manager sends him a Chinese song, which Bart translates into English, with the help of Google Translate. Hours later, Bart’s English version of the track is burning up the top ranks in Douyin (China’s version of TikTok).

Bart sees immense potential in the Chinese market, and has already announced that he is quitting YouTube. Meanwhile, his Chinese manager is concerned that Bart’s American persona could be trouble in China, if it isn’t properly handled.

VICE News met with Bart Baker in Los Angeles, and his manager in Shanghai, to see if Bart’s path might be a way forward for other struggling YouTubers.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

LFclz1sAUg0,2020-05-22,I Volunteered to Get Coronavirus...To Help Find A Vaccine,"Finding a vaccine for COVID-19 might take longer than you think. 

It has to not just be effective against the coronavirus, but safe too. With potentially billions of people eligible to get it, it’s important the side effects don’t harm more than they help. All that requires clinical trials and testing that could take a long time.

To speed up that process, some people are volunteering to be deliberately infected with the virus. They want their bodies to become instant samples for scientists to study. We talk to a young woman about what’s driving her to do this, and why she’s willing to possibly do some serious damage to her body in the name of fighting COVID-19.

Chernobyl still holds the distinction of being the world’s worst nuclear disaster. And the job of containing the fallout has required an international cast of players. A year ago, crews finished putting the new sarcophagus in place. It’s a massive steel arch -- officially called the New Safe Confinement -- that covers the destroyed reactor. Now, workers are busy sealing up the space between the new sarcophagus and the old one-- which was built in the 80s. And they’re facing some of the highest levels of radiation they’ve encountered so far. Jake Hanrahan got an exclusive look.

This isn't just something that's happening in the United States – it's happening throughout the world. Often, these outbreaks begin with unvaccinated people. They spread through them, too. Outbreaks occur because of a breakdown in herd immunity. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

It's the Food Bank For NYC's $29 a week challenge, and Gwyneth Paltrow is the latest celeb to take it on. Naturally, the Internet has a lot to say about it, and naturally, Buckley has a lot to say about what the Internet has to say about it.

XWJtRI1gDCE,2016-08-09,You Can Do a Lot to Prevent Some Cancers,"Americans seem very afraid of cancer. Much of this fear is legitimate. Cancer is a significant cause of death. Unlike other causes, it often seems to come out of nowhere. It's the ""silent killer"".

But evidence increasingly argues that cancer may be preventable, too. Unfortunately, this has inflamed as much as it has assuaged people's fears.

Cancer prevention is the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

This episode was adapted from a column Aaron wrote for The Upshot. Links to references and further reading can be found there: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/upshot/helpless-to-prevent-cancer-actually-a-lot-is-in-your-control.html?_r=0

Sometimes researchers don't do careful work, and the systems in place don't always prevent weak research from being published. Add that to the fact that media outlets tend to overblow stories about food and cancer, and it's a recipe for research disaster.

But Are These Studies Helping?","You may have heard of a recent study published in JAMA that once again confirmed that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is not related to autism. I just met the author of the study at a recent meeting, and she told me that the study is evidently the number one most downloaded from JAMA. Ever.
The study's findings, widely covered in the media, are considered robust and important. But it may be time to question how much good continued research in this area is doing. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

It turns out, the measles vaccine was doing more than we previously thought. Getting infected with measles doesn't only make you sick, and carry a risk of death, it can also wipe out pre-existing immunity to other illnesses, making you more susceptible to other infections.

pGPc5iJFGm0,2020-02-22,"Trains Not Stopping in Codogno, Italy, Amid Coronavirus Fears","Train stations are closed in the Italian region of Lombardy, as it goes into lockdown over coronavirus fears, Saturday, February 22.
–––––––––
READ MORE: Italian officials ordered schools, public buildings, restaurants and coffee shops closed in a tiny town in northern Italy Friday after six people tested positive for the new virus, including some who had not been to China, the source of the global health emergency.
    
The new cases represented the first infections in Italy acquired through secondary contagion and tripled the country's total to nine. The first to fall ill met with someone in early February who had returned from China on Jan. 21 without presenting any symptoms of the new virus, health authorities said.
    
Authorities think that person passed the virus onto a 38-year-old Italian, who went to a hospital in the town of Codogno with flulike symptoms on Feb. 18 but was sent home. He returned to the hospital after his condition worsened and is now in intensive care, Lombardy region public welfare director Giulio Gallera said.

Juncker addressed MEPs at the European Parliament for the first time after the United Kingdom chose to leave the European Union in a referendum on Thursday (23 June).

More about this video:
This video supports a 30 minute documentary, The Cursed Twins, in which Reporter Kiki King and Director David Fuller visit Madagascar, where the dead make the rules and a set of taboos, handed down from long-dead ancestors, controls what you eat, when you work and every aspect of how you behave.

In a country where the dead make the rules, families with twins are torn between displeasing the ancestors and bringing illness and misfortune on themselves and their villages, or giving up their children.

No one is sure how the taboo against twins, and the belief that they bring bad luck, arose, but most stories talk about an ancient battle that caused a tribe to flee their village.

King and Fuller also meet Carolin, who is considered especially unlucky as she has given birth to three sets of twins. She says she has had to move house around 30 times, because her neighbours feared the twins.",Channel 4,UCz1hQ68G3XPVYEBoFDgSjcQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz1hQ68G3XPVYEBoFDgSjcQ,26424.0,13.0,77.0,120.0,[],"['channel 4', '4od', 'entertainment', 'british television', 'broadcaster', 'Unreported World (TV Program)', 'cursed', 'curse', 'twins', 'madagascar', 'spell', 'ancestors', 'myth', 'child', 'children']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hk07V-887HM/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-vaxx,pseudoscience,,34

In the wake of rapid global development, cancer now kills more people in the developing world than malaria, HIV/Aids and tuberculosis combined. Added to this, many medical professionals struggle to secure adequate pain relief, leaving thousands of adults and children in unbearable agony. 

70,000 people in Senegal are in need of morphine to manage acute pain now that cancer kills more people in Africa than AIDS, TB and Malaria combined. With cancer cases set to rise to 24 million by 2035, the need for effective pain has never been more crucial. Unfortunately in Senegal a complex bureaucracy and the need for more knowledge about effective pain relief has left many medical professionals feeling helpless and thousands of people, including young children, unnecessarily suffering extreme agony.

More about this video:
This video supports a 30 minute documentary, Africa's Drugs Scandal, in which Reporter Krishnan Guru-Murthy and Director Daniel Bogado travel to Senegal to reveal how patients across the continent are being deprived of the single most important drug for relieving the pain of cancer -- morphine -  despite governments having funds to purchase the supplies.

The scandalous shortage of morphine in Senegal is being repeated across the developing world and affects millions. It is needless cruelty, reflects Guru-Murthy. But without the political will to change, vulnerable people remain deprived of humane treatment and an end to life free of pain.

Channel 4 on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Channel4 | Facebook: https://facebook.com/Channel4

The illicit trade in rhino horn for the Asian market has skyrocketed in recent years. It has become one of the most valuable commodities in the world, worth as much as gold, diamonds and cocaine. Last year 1,215 rhinos were killed in South Africa - a record high and the numbers are still increasing. Smugglers have set their sights on the African game reserves that are home to 75 per cent of the world’s remaining rhinos. Poachers are killing one animal every seven hours and if they continue at the same rate, rhinos will become extinct in the wild in less than 10 years.

But a new group has emerged to fight for the rhino’s survival. The Black Mambas are a unit of 26 women from villages around Balule, a collection of privately owned game reserves in South Africa. 

Siphiwe Sithole is one of the Mambas. She’s aware of the risks involved in her job - the poachers are willing to use violence to get rhino horn, given the potential profits involved and the lack of job opportunities for local people. 86 per cent of people who live in the region are unemployed and very few make any money from game reserve tourism - which they see as the preserve of rich white people. 

Poaching can be a tempting option to make a lot of cash - but can Siphiwe and the other Mambas convince locals that their region will suffer in the long-term if all the rhinos are killed?",Channel 4,UCz1hQ68G3XPVYEBoFDgSjcQ,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz1hQ68G3XPVYEBoFDgSjcQ,16445.0,6.0,138.0,204.0,[],"['channel 4', '4od', 'entertainment', 'british television', 'broadcaster', 'Mamba (Organism Classification)', 'Rhinoceros (Animal)', 'Save The Rhino (Organization)', 'animal cruelty', 'rhino', 'rhino poaching', 'poachers africa']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s6DkQFtmliE/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-vaxx,pseudoscience,,41

 “Subsequent clusters are derived from the original cluster,” he said.

http://shomusbiology.weebly.com/bio-materials.html
Vaccines work by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response, but there are several ways to do this. Four main types are currently in clinical use:

    An inactivated vaccine consists of virus or bacteria that are grown in culture and then killed using a method such as heat or formaldehyde. Although the virus or bacteria particles are destroyed and cannot replicate, the virus capsid proteins or bacterial wall are intact enough to be recognized and remembered by the immune system and evoke a response. When manufactured correctly, the vaccine is not infectious, but improper inactivation can result in intact and infectious particles. Since the properly produced vaccine does not reproduce, booster shots are required periodically to reinforce the immune response.
    In an attenuated vaccine, live virus or bacteria with very low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce and continue to present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (infectious bursal disease virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus [3], avian metapneumovirus [4])[21]
    Virus-like particle vaccines consist of viral protein(s) derived from the structural proteins of a virus. These proteins can self-assemble into particles that resemble the virus from which they were derived but lack viral nucleic acid, meaning that they are not infectious. Because of their highly repetitive, multivalent structure, virus-like particles are typically more immunogenic than subunit vaccines (described below). The human papillomavirus and Hepatitis B virus vaccines are two virus-like particle-based vaccines currently in clinical use.
    A subunit vaccine presents an antigen to the immune system without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a bacterial toxin) and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will induce antibodies that may not recognize the infectious organism. In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.

A number of other vaccine strategies are under experimental investigation. These include DNA vaccination and recombinant viral vectors. Source of the article published in description is Wikipedia. I am sharing their material. Copyright by original content developers of Wikipedia.

kkvslrfaCLY,2019-02-11,How CRISPR Changes Human DNA Forever,"A Chinese scientist claims to have created the world’s first genetically-engineered babies. He used CRISPR, a revolutionary gene-editing technology, to deactivate a gene in their DNA linked to HIV infection. Editing human DNA in this way could save lives, but many researchers fear unintended consequences.

Following is a transcript of the video:

In 2011, scientists created glow-in-the-dark cats. The researchers took a gene from a glowing jellyfish and inserted it into the unfertilized eggs of house cats. It was a neat trick, but they had a bigger goal in mind. They also made the cats more likely to be resistant to a feline form of AIDS by, again, manipulating their DNA. And cats aren’t that different than humans. In fact, we share around 90 percent of our DNA with them. 

So why can’t we engineer humans in the same way? Well, we can – engineer ourselves to be resistant to life-threatening illnesses, that is. In fact, one scientist claims that he’s genetically engineered two babies using a revolutionary tool called CRISPR. But what exactly is a CRISPR baby, anyway? 

Would you like to be six feet tall? Or never bald? The secret to traits like these lies in the six billion letters of your genetic code. But there can be something else in there as well. Mutations. Genetic mutations are linked to at least 6,000 medical conditions, from sickle cell anemia to Huntington’s disease. But what if you could make those mutations simply disappear? That’s where the gene-editing tool CRISPR comes in. 

CRISPR is made from specialized proteins and other compounds found in certain bacteria. Normally, these proteins protect the bacteria by destroying enemy invaders like viruses, but the inventors of CRISPR figured out how to turn those proteins against genetic mutations and other genes linked to disease.  

First, they give the proteins coordinates of the wanted gene. Then, CRISPR runs a seek-and-destroy function. After that, other molecules are dispatched to repair the gene with new, healthy DNA. And just like that, you can edit the human genome. 

But while edits may be quick, their changes can last for centuries. Especially if you’re editing the DNA in an embryo. Embryos start out with a single cell that eventually replicates into millions and then trillions more. So, if you alter that initial cell first, you’re manipulating the ingredients for every cell that follows later in life, and those same altered cells can be passed on from generation to generation. That’s one reason why most experiments on human embryos haven’t left the lab. 

That is, except for the work of Dr. He Jiankui. He claims to have used CRISPR to target and knock out the CCR5 gene in human embryos, which is linked to HIV infection. And then he did something that shocked the scientific community. He implanted the embryos into several women, one of whom gave birth to genetically modified twins. Resistance to HIV aside, most scientists say that the procedure was too risky.  At least two studies suggest that edited cells might actually trigger cancer. And another found that CRISPR can accidentally take aim at healthy DNA. 

So, while CRISPR could make us immune to disease, who knows what else we might get on the side?

FRANCE 24 live news stream: all the latest news 24/7
http://f24.my/YTliveEN

Vaccines have been credited with reducing some of the world's most deadly diseases. But while the market for vaccinations has tripled since the turn of the century, representing over $25 billion a year, and is expected to continue to rise rapidly, more and more people are starting to decide not to take them. The number of measles infections last year in the EU was three times what it was in 2016, notably because some people had decided not to get immunised.
Dr Richard Halvorsen is the Medical Director of a children's immunisation clinic in London and author of ""Vaccines: Making the Right Choice for Your Child"". He gives us his perspective on the pros and cons of the inoculations. Dr Halvorsen says his main concern is the number of vaccines some people now take. ""We are adding more and more vaccinations. Some diseases we vaccinate against are mild or almost impossible to contract. Let's be clear: vaccines can save lives, there is no question about that, but also all vaccines have side effects."" 
As with all medication, Dr Halvorsen says each patient is a unique case and one has to look at the benefits to taking it compared to the risk of infection. While side effects are rare, like with all medication they can occur. ""We should be cautious when we add more and more vaccines for diseases that are less important,"" he told FRANCE 24. ""I'm not saying we should not vaccinate,"" he added, ""but we should have a debate about the benefits and risks.""

KBLINrDA9q4,2015-07-14,"Puppy Vaccinations, injections & Shots - Vet Advice","#dogvaccinations, injections or puppyshots are crucial to give young dogs healthy start in life. In this video, four Great Dane puppies arrive at Abbey House Veterinary Hospital for their first vaccinations. Vet Laura Smith explains what  a #doginoculation is and why they're so vital to dog's health. The veterinary advice given in this video is of a general nature only. If you are concerned about your own dog's health, always take them to your vet. The vets at Abbey House Veterinary Group see 700 dogs every week across their three branches in West Yorkshire. If you have a puppy or new dog one of the most important reasons you’ll visit your vet is for their #doginjections.

When puppies are born they are usually protected from infections by their intake of colustrum – the rich milk provided by their mother during the first days of their life.
However, this protection only lasts a few weeks so puppies need regular vaccinations from an early age.
Vaccinations are something that we recommend for all puppies. They’re standard vaccinations that vaccinate them against distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, which is something that is quite common, parainfluenza and leptospirosis. Most of those are quite rare luckily at the moment, and that’s because so many dogs are vaccinated. It’s parvovirus that is the one that’s still out there that we do see quite a bit of. Most of these are transmitted from dog to dog. So that’s why it’s really important to get your dog vaccinated. 
If the number of dogs protected by vaccines drop– your pet could be at risk of an outbreak of infectious diseases – some of which can be transmitted to humans.  
Puppies are typically vaccinated at eight and ten weeks with an initial course of two injections.  Your dog should then be given a booster 12 months after their first vaccination.
It’s also advisable to have your dog vaccinated against a highly contagious disease called kennel cough. The condition may not be life threatening but it can be very irritable and uncomfortable for your dog.
We do recommend kennel cough vaccination, especially if your dog is going to come into contact with other dogs. So if it’s going into kennels, competing in any shows, going to training classes, then it’s the correct situation for a dog to pick up kennel cough, so we do recommend the kennel cough vaccination. Because kennel cough is caused by so many different bacteria and viruses, the kennel cough vaccination in itself is not 100 per cent effective, because it doesn’t cover all the different causes, but it does rule out most of them. So if your dog is going to be put in that situation, we’d recommend it vaccinated. 

Puppies and dogs also need to have regular flea and worming treatments. The most common internal parasites that infest puppies are roundworms and tapeworms.  Unfortunately there’s no preventative treatment that will stop your dog from becoming infected but there are a number of effective products that will kill the parasites.


We recommend regular working for all dogs. Puppies should have been wormed by the breeder before you’ve got them, but it not then go to your vets and they can provide some worming treatment for you. We recommend all puppies are wormed every month until six months old, and then dogs every three to four months throughout the year.
Most puppies, you see no side effects after they’ve had their vaccination.",Dog Advice Videos,UCE_YoShdNKUEy8wNTtctnRw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_YoShdNKUEy8wNTtctnRw,28289.0,7.0,150.0,342.0,[],"['dog vaccinations', 'dog innoculations', 'dog injections', 'puppy vaccinations', 'puppy innoculations', 'puppy injections', 'dog shots', 'puppy shots', 'puppy vaccinations uk', 'puppy vaccinations when safe to go outside', 'puppy vaccinations crying', 'puppy shots crying', 'puppy shots schedule', 'puppy shots at 6 weeks', 'puppy shots before going outside', 'puppy first injections', 'dog puppy injections', 'कुत्ते का टीकाकरण', 'पिल्ला टीकाकरण', 'पिल्ला शॉट्स', 'कुत्ते को इंजेक्शन', 'पिल्ला इंजेक्शन']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBLINrDA9q4/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-vaccination,science,,47

Global health (and public health) is truly multidisciplinary and leans on epidemiology, health economics, health policy, statistics, ethics, demography.... the list goes on and on. This YouTube channel is here to provide you with some teaching and information on these topics. I've also posted some videos on how to find work in the global health space and how to raise money or get a grant for your projects. 

Please feel free to leave comments and questions - I'll respond to all of them (we'll, I'll try to at least). Feel free to make suggestions as to future content for the channel.

JAn14NS71fI,2019-04-27,Pourquoi certains vaccins sont obligatoires (feat. Dans ton corps),"La méfiance à l’encontre de ces vaccins en France est élevée. Elle repose souvent sur une peur des dangers supposés des effets secondaires. Résultat, une mouvance anti-vaccin s'est peu à peu développée. 

En France, par exemple, entre 2000 et 2016, la proportion de Français défavorables aux vaccins est passée de 9 à 25 %. Selon l’Unicef, la peur du vaccin est l’une des causes principales du défaut de vaccination dans le monde. Aux Etats-Unis par exemple, plus de 2,5 millions d’enfants n’ont pas été vaccinés contre la rougeole entre 2010 et 2017.

Alors pour quelles raisons oblige-t-on les gens à se vacciner ? Explications en vidéo.

[Erratum : le rappel de vaccin à 25 ans n'est pas obligatoire. L’âge des vaccins obligatoires, depuis 2018, s’arrête à 18 mois. https://bit.ly/2IQddKv]

pAoEHR4aW8I,2019-04-10,Why this black hole photo is such a big deal,"What it took to collect these 54-million-year-old photons from a supermassive black hole.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

This is an updated version of a video we published in 2016 about the Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration to image a black hole for the first time in human history. 

On April 10, 2019, the team announced their results: They had successfully imaged the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy m87, which is nearly 54 million light-years away from us. They were able to achieve unprecedented resolution using very long baseline interferometry, which combines the observations of multiple radio telescopes across the globe. 

The team wanted to find out whether Einstein's Theory of General Relativity holds up in the extreme environment of black holes, and the results do, in fact, seem to be consistent with the predictions. In the future, we may see more and shaper images of black holes as the team targets smaller wavelengths of light and recruits more telescopes. Eventually, they may include an orbiting space telescope.

48% of Americans profess to believe in ghosts, and around a quarter say that they've actually seen a ghost before. I wanted to find out if there was any proof of their existence, so I spoke with Joe Nickell, allegedly the world's only paranormal investigator who had researched reported hauntings for almost 50 years.

He says that he's never seen any evidence that would point towards the existence of ghosts. Nickell walks us through the various scientific explanations for why people think they see ghosts, including sleep paralysis, waking dreams, traumatic grief, and exposure to infrasound.

So even though there may be no evidence that ghosts exist, that doesn't mean that you might not see one.

puAGzj0W0Qs,2016-04-26,This Commonly Prescribed Drug Could Help Treat Autism,"Researchers at the University of Missouri are studying how a commonly prescribed beta blocker could be used to treat individuals with autism.

""There was a study done in the 1980s that suggested a social and language benefit with this blood pressure drug, propranolol,"" Dr. David Beversdorf said.

Propranolol has been used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases since the 1960s. Dr. David Beversdorf and his colleagues wanted to explore other possible uses for the drug.

In their study, individuals with autism who took the drug instead of a placebo showed higher scores in social skills, such as eye contact, nonverbal communication and staying on topic.

""We were initially looking at it because of its use for test anxiety. That's exactly the drug people take for public speaking anxiety, performance anxiety. ...  And then we started to look at it in autism because they have flexibility issues with social interaction,"" Beversdorf said.

Propranolol is currently FDA-approved to treat a lot of things. Autism is not one of them.

An Autism Treatment Network spokesperson said the organization welcomes the research but also warned it's still too early to start prescribing the drug to people with autism.

This fall, researchers plan to conduct clinical trials that combine propranolol with early-intervention therapies. Beversdorf says the trial could take up to four years.

fKsCjS9iVZg,2018-11-07,Nijla Mu'min Brings a Black Muslim Coming-of-Age Story to the Big Screen | KQED Arts,"Nijla Mu’min didn’t grow up with much media that reflected her experience as an African-American Muslim woman, so she created her own. Her semi-autobiographical film, 'Jinn,' follows a teen girl named Summer as she navigates friendship, love, sexuality—and all the confusing territory that comes with being a teenager—while adjusting to her mom’s newfound Islamic faith. “I love the African-American Muslim community I was born into, but just like many teenage girls and teenagers, I began to question a lot as I got older,” says Mu’min, who was born and raised in the East Bay and attended a mosque in East Oakland.

After Summer’s mom converts to Islam, her expectations of her daughter clash with Summer’s lived reality as a high schooler in Los Angeles, where Mu’min shot the film. Questions of family and belonging, faith and community arise as Summer attempts to balance her religion and the pressures of being a teen—something Mu’min went through as a young girl in the Bay Area, though she says her parents weren’t quite as strict. Mu’min, whose directorial credits include Ava Duvernay's hit series Queen Sugar on Oprah's TV network, addresses these threads of inquiry with skill; her characters don’t have all the answers, and the messy ways they respond to their complex circumstances makes them feel all the more human.

'Jinn' enjoyed a successful run on the festival circuit, picking up awards at SXSW and the Blackstar Film Festival. Following a sold-out Oakland premiere last month at the Matatu Festival at Grand Lake Theatre, 'Jinn' hits theaters on Nov. 15.

Symptoms of the virus include: fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes, sore throat, Koplik's spots and a rash. Measles spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. You can catch Measles in a room where a person with the virus has been up to two hours after the person has left. According to the CDC, Measles cases are on the rise nationwide because more Americans are traveling internationally. The virus is also spreading in communities with pockets of unvaccinated people, who are greatest at risk.

ounaJeW2bDA,2017-04-09,"Measles (rubeola) - causes, symptoms, treatment (vaccines) & pathology","This is an animated video explaining measles & measles vaccination.This video is based on the PARK Textbook of Community Medicine.


Hi friends............Welcome to abmbbs.......Today's topic is MEASLES....First up Measles is caused by Paramyxovirus which is a RNA virus.....

next, what is the incubation period of measles??it is 10 to 14days.......now if you consider this to be the timeline.....& this as the point of exposure on day 0....then.....fever occurs on day 10 & rash occurs on day 14.
But remember......the incubation period of vaccine induced measles is only 7 days...

next, the source of measles infection is from cases.... there is no carrier in measles...there is no animal reservoir too.....

the mode of transmission of measles is by air droplets

the period of communicability of measles is from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of rash...

the Secondary attack rate of measles is 80%

measles also shows seasonal trend every 2 to 3 yrs....and it mainly occurs in the period of january to april that is in early spring

the clinical features of measles is divided into 3 stages......the 1st stage which is the prodromal stage causes fever, coryza & nasal discharge...............in the eruptive stage dusky red coloured maculopapular rash occurs....like this.....mind you the rash begins from behind the ear....that is it has retro auricular origin.
….................................in this stage koplik spot also occurs.....like this....this one....& this one....it is a characteristic sign of measles......it occurs in the buccal mucosa opposite the 2nd molar............................finally there is the Post measles stage which is characterised by wt loss & diarrhoea.


Next, the complications of measles....otitis media is the most common complication.....& pneumonia is the most common life threatening complication....another late complication of measles is called SSPE which stands for sub acute sclerosing pan encephalitis....it is extremely rare & occurs in about 7 per million cases of measles.

Finally we come to the topic of measles vaccine....this one.........it is a live attenuated freeze dried lyophilised vaccine....i have explained the meaning of each of these words in my previous video on BCG vaccination....the link is available right here...

the measles vaccine is most commonly derived from the Edmonston zagreb strain

what is the dose?....the dose is 0.5ml given subcutaneously in the antero lateral aspect of thigh.

The diluent used is distilled water & not normal saline

the vaccine is to be stored at 2 to 8 degree celsius...

the measles vaccine is  remarkable since it not only gives a protective efficacy of 90% with just the 1st dose but also gives lifelong protection
bt it is susceptable to light & must be stored in dark vials

finally when is the measles vaccine given??......it is given exactly at 9 months age......why?.....bcz till 9 months the maternal antibodies protect the baby & any vaccination before that would be rendered ineffective by the natural antibodies acquired from the mother. 
But immunization later than 9 months means that many children will contract measles in the interval between the weaning off of the natural antibodies & the introduction of the vaccine.So the WHO expanded immunization program has recommended immunization at 9 months & india has adopted the same.

Which at first seems not very important until you realize that one third of all food humans consume would disappear with them. Millions could starve. The foes bees face are truly horrifying – some are a direct consequence of human greed. We need to help our small buzzing friends or we will face extremely unpleasant consequences.

rkqUjeQNEQs,2011-08-18,"How cats become infected with feline coronavirus, the virus which causes FIP","Feline coronavirus (FCoV), which causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in a small percentage of infected cats, is shed in the faeces. FCoV infection occurs when cats ingest (or inhale) the virus. FCoV is very contagious and it only takes a tiny speck of contaminated cat litter to infect a kitten or cat. 
FCoV lasts up to 7 weeks in the house (it is not as stable as parvovirus, which survives for a year, but is more stable than feline herpesvirus which only survives ~12 hours). FCoV is protected by faeces and cat litter (unless it has anti-virus properties). Outdoors, cats bury their faeces and FCoV is rapidly broken down in the soil. Cats do not seek out each others’ faeces, as dogs do, so there is a good chance of the FCoV dying long before another cat is exposed to it.
In this animation we meet Augustus, a healthy FCoV-infected cat, and we see how his faeces contains billions of highly infectious virus particles. Augustus will shed virus in his faeces for a few weeks or months, then will stop shedding virus: nobody might ever know that he was infected. Enter Plato, an uninfected cat who has to share a litter tray with Augustus. Even if the tray has been de-clumped since Augustus used it, it will still contain enormous amounts of coronavirus. The virus gets onto Plato’s paws as he covers his own toilet, and when he grooms himself, he licks virus off his paws and swallows it. We believe that the virus first infects the cells lining the small intestine (i.e. the epithelial cells of the villi). Once a cat is infected with FCoV, a battle begins between the immune system and the virus. Happily most cats who become infected only shed the virus for a few weeks or months, then stop. However, an unfortunate 5-10% of FCoV-infected cats go on to develop FIP. 
The best way to prevent FCoV transmission is to ensure that you only bring FCoV-negative cats into your house. Allow your cats outdoors if it is safe to do so. If cats must be confined indoors, have at least one litter tray for every cat in the house—preferably in different rooms. There are cat flaps which recognise specific cat microchips: I use Staywell cat doors. Use covered or self-cleaning litter trays. Some people train their cats to use human toilets. It takes only a tiny speck of infected cat litter dust blown onto cat food for a cat to become infected, so keep food and water bowls as far away from litter trays as possible. In this animation there is an easily disinfected floor, and a dirt trapper mat placed near the litter tray, to capture microscopic particles of infected cat litter, but there are too few litter trays, so the cats had to share. 
THE BEST CAT LITTERS TO HELP PREVENT THIS VIRUS
Research at catvirus.com has shown that the type of cat litter you use will affect the transmission of FCoV between your cats. No litter completely prevents FCoV transmission, but using a cat litter which tracks minimally, and which has some anti-virus properties, helps: we found that the best litter was Dr Elsey's Cat Attract.  EverClean clumping and World's Best Cat Litter are also good. The worst litters for FCoV transmission are the wood pellets which turn into sawdust and track all over the house.

Speak up dear cause I cannot hear you
I need to know why we don't trust them

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
And tell me how I've lost my power

Where can I turn? Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty I'm so unsure
Tell me why I feel so alone cause I need to Know to whom do I owe

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
And tell me how I've lost my power

I thought that we'd make it
Because you said that we'd make it through
And when all security fails
Will you be there to help me through

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
And tell me how I've lost my power

I've lost my power

LYRICS: 

(verse)

It's gettin' lonely way out here
Yeah, space'll do that to you, but let me be clear
I'm one heartbroken satellite

You see, it's been a while since I've seen you around
40 years since you last touched my lunar ground
So a call, at least, would be nice

(chorus)
You moved on to better things
Said it was the money, but maybe it's me
And you changed everything with one giant leap
And then you left me, oh, maybe
It's a conspiracy

I don't know this Houston guy
But I'll bet he can't shine as bright as I
Oh, there's so much of me you've yet to learn

And worst of all, you left your little prints on me
Stuck a pretty thorn in my side, oh, is that all you need?
You've been gone so long, but the memory still hurts

(chorus)

Oh, what can I do?
Until you return, I'll watch the asteroids burn
I just don't glow like I used to
And as I count the days, I'm drifting further and further and further and further and further and further away

bJKkFJyDlYI,2015-10-05,We shouldn’t use labels like “Alternative” and “Conventional” Medicine,"What is alternative medicine? Does alternative medicine work? The University of Toronto recently stirred up a bit of controversy by uncritically offering a class on ""Alternative Medicine."" When people looked at the coursework, which included many studies debunked by this channel, some people started to freak out. The issue highlights a much larger problem: No one is sure how best to teach that subject.

The dichotomy, however, between alternative and traditional medicine, or between Eastern and Western medicine, is a false one. We would be much better off if we could reframe the issue. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

 
This episode was based on a post I wrote for the Upshot. Links to sources and more reading can be found there: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/upshot/labels-like-alternative-medicine-dont-matter-the-science-does.html

P1aQKDtvRJM,2015-04-02,Germer les lentilles/ Comment faire germer les lentilles,"Germer les lentilles/ Comment faire germer les les lentilles https://naturopathemariesoleil.com/

Saviez-vous qu'il est possible de faire germer vos lentilles?
Puis-je manger les lentilles germées & crues?

Trempage: 6 à 8 heures
Durée de la germination: 4 à 6 jours ( Avoir 1/2 pouce de germe)

La germination transforme la composition de la lentille vers un état vivant.

Les lentilles germées sont élevées en vitamines B, vitamine C, carotène & protéine végétale. 

La germination modifie les sucres que contiennent les lentilles ce qui réduit les gaz! Bonne nouvelle!

Suggestions: salades de lentilles germées, soupe de lentilles germées,...

*Pour consommer les lentilles non cuites, il est important de tremper & de faire germer les lentilles correctement. Les lentilles crues contiennent des acides phytiques qui sont difficiles à digérer. Le trempage & la germination permettent de neutraliser les phytates. Ceci permet une meilleure absorption des vitamines & des minéraux.

Si vous ne respectez pas ces consignes, les lentilles crues sont considérées toxiques. Donc, pour absorber et profiter des bienfaits des lentilles germées crues, il est essentiel de respecter la durée de germination ou d'avoir 1/2 pouce de germe. La germination transforme l'état de dormance de cette semence en état actif & vivant!

Matériels nécessaires:
-1 pot en verre
-1 Tasse de lentilles
-Coton à fromage ou linge à vaisselle
-Élastique
-Passoir

Instructions:
-Rincer les lentilles & faire tremper les lentilles pendant 6 à 8 heures.

-Rincer les lentilles et les mettre dans un pot en verre.

-Mettre le coton à fromage ou le linge à vaisselle à l'extrémité du pot et le tenir avec un élastique.

-Mettre le pot dans un endroit sans lumière en angle de 45 degrés.

-Rincer les légumineuses matin & soir pendant 4 à 6 jours ou jusqu'à ce que vous ayez un germe de 1/2 pouce.

-Conservation: 1 semaine au réfrigérateur",Marie-Soleil,UClVn0ducMJmurGSSM8mV6aw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClVn0ducMJmurGSSM8mV6aw,44471.0,19.0,561.0,293.0,[],"['lentilles germées', 'germination', 'naturopathe', 'Marie-Soleil']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/P1aQKDtvRJM/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-vaccination,pseudoscience,,0
QXT4OVM4vXI,2013-07-16,Atomic Hook-Ups - Types of Chemical Bonds: Crash Course Chemistry #22,"Atoms are a lot like us - we call their relationships ""bonds,"" and there are many different types. Each kind of atomic relationship requires a different type of energy, but they all do best when they settle into the lowest stress situation possible. The nature of the bond between atoms is related to the distance between them and, like people, it also depends on how positive or negative they are. Unlike human relationships, we can analyze exactly what makes chemical relationships work, and that's what this episode is all about. 

If you are paying attention, you will learn that chemical bonds form in order to minimize the energy difference between two atoms or ions; that those chemical bonds may be covalent if atoms share electrons, and that covalent bonds can share those electrons evenly or unevenly; that bonds can also be ionic if the electrons are transferred instead of shared: and how to calculate the energy transferred in an ionic bond using Coulomb's Law. 

Pssst... we made flashcards to help you review the content in this episode! Find them on the free Crash Course App!

In US news and current events today, the U.S. is slowly starting to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted lockdowns and stay-at-home orders across the country. But the coronavirus is still taking a massive toll on the country, and anti-lockdown protesters pushing back against stay-at-home orders are coming out in droves in states like Michigan, North Carolina, California, and Minnesota.

In Minnesota, a group of nurses working the front lines of COVID19 protected the streets to nearby hospitals from anti-lockdown protesters. Hundreds of people joined in a drive-by rally at the Minnesota State Capitol put together by a group called Gridlock Minnesota to call on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to end the state's stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus pandemic. 'As a nurse, I’m the first person you’re gonna run over if you open the state up and just let people congregate,' said one nurse facing off with the anti-lockdown coronavirus protesters.

In US news and current events today, Richard Rothstein, The Color of Law author, continues his lifelong mission to debunk the myth of de facto segregation and explain how modern day segregation is enforced by US law and policy. Insidious tactics like redlining have contributed to modern day segregation, and it leads to modern school segregation, modern housing segregation and housing discrimination, and so much more. De jure discrimination didn't end with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, it simply became more insidious and baked into the housing, lending and education systems that have prevented Black Americans from earning and keeping wealth. Modern segregation is no less immoral and unjust than explicit segregation, and the entire system needs an overhaul if we are ever to reach true equality and assert that Black lives matter.

In US news and current events today, President Donald J. Trump has claimed to be the smartest, most intelligent president in US history, though his knowledge of the country's past leaves somewhat to be desired. From his defense of Andrew Jackson, complete misunderstanding of the Confederacy and why the Confederate Army was fighting in the Civil War history, and numerous other inaccuracies about world history and U.S. history, this President Trump history lesson will no doubt leave you dumber about the state of history. For President Trump, smart is a state of mind, and while many have cast doubts on the President's intelligence, we'll let this Trump history lesson speak for itself.

""Austin's Alex Jones is at it again, y'all.

In a widely circulated act that Twitter user rskanse called ""some next level Karen-ing,"" the far-right conspiracy theorist verbally harassed lifeguards at Barton Springs in Austin, bullhorn in hand, all because they were doing their job.

Referring to employees and hikers as ""cult member kooks,"" he said his wife showed up at the park location Monday morning and was unable to enter after employees asked for her reservation.

Bull Creek Greenbelt and Barton Creek Greenbelt reopened Monday, Aug. 8, but to limit large gatherings amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Austin now requires a reservation ahead of visits — a move Jones said is unconstitutional.""

Stephen Colbert took over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!""",The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig,683029.0,189.0,4945.0,185.0,[],"['The Late Show', 'Stephen Colbert', 'Colbert', 'Late Show', 'celebrities', 'late night', 'talk show', 'skits', 'bit', 'monologue', 'The Late Late Show', 'Late Late Show', 'letterman', 'david letterman', 'comedian', 'impressions', 'CBS', 'joke', 'jokes', 'funny', 'funny video', 'funny videos', 'humor', 'celebrity', 'celeb', 'hollywood', 'famous', 'James Corden', 'Corden', 'Comedy', 'Samantha Bee', 'Jason Jones', 'The Detour', 'Detour']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/j0m38GBzLds/sddefault.jpg,,,yes,,anti-mask,pseudoscience,,27

In several Texas counties, local ordinances are now requiring businesses to enact and enforce a policy requiring their customers to wear masks inside an establishment.

They have ended their assault on the doctor after they realized that their strategy blew up in their faces and that the public actually likes Fauci and trusts him to handle the crisis more than they do this administration.

*This transcript was generated by a third-party transcription software company, so please excuse any typos.

So this week began with an unnamed member of Donald Trump's team, sending out a list of alleged lies that dr. Anthony Fauci told in the early days of the pandemic, they sent that list out to media outlets all over the country. This was part of the smear campaign that had begun in earnest a couple days before that on Wednesday of last week, when Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, a guy that knows nothing of infectious diseases published an op ed, where he called out Fauci said the dude's just been lying since day one. In fact, Navarro specifically did say, he's lied about everything I've ever worked with him on which you're you're in charge of trade. So I can't imagine you would have ever or should have ever worked with him, but okay. Whatever. And so that's how the week began. They were absolutely running the smear campaign against Fowchee. 

And then suddenly this Wednesday, yo just one week after it officially began, Trump comes out is asked a question about all this stuff about Fauci. And he says in the press conference, I love Fauci our work in them all the time. I have no problem with him. You know, I don't know whatever Peter did, you know, that's that's on him. We, we don't, you know, agree with that. I don't agree with what the staffer did. We, we love Fauci. We listened to Fauci. So suddenly suddenly the white house that had this coordinated effort to take down Fauci suddenly on Wednesday, they're acting like the first I've heard of it. Love this guy. 

It's my, my boss guy. Right? 

So I call him dr. Fauci. You know the [inaudible] ha no, that's not how it happened. You Donald Trump just actually last Thursday, we're on Sean Hannity's program on Fox news, where you said that he, he was wrong about so very many things you said he lied. You did that. We can verify that that clip exists. It's online. People can find it. It's in the articles talking about how you've suddenly changed your tune about Fowchee. We know that you're lying and we know why too, as it stands right now, dr. Anthony Fauci, yo, even though, yes, he was mistaken about things in the early days. Most of us were, we didn't know anything. This really is an unprecedented situation. We were learning. As we went, we had to change. Things, had to change. Our beliefs had to change what we knew about it. As new things came in. 

That's what happens. But anyway, Paul show right now, dr. Fowchee is the most trusted person in this administration. And I think that actually goes to overall, just in general, most trusted, not just most trusted the handle, the pandemic, but the most trusted Fauci has worked for six different administrations, advising presidents on infectious diseases. This guy knows what he is doing. Is he always right? Nope. But did he intentionally the public in the early days of this one time he admitted that yes, he did. He did that order to preserve people PE for doctors and first responders. So you know what, I'm a give him a pass on that. I really, yeah. He didn't want people going out there and stockpiling masks and gloves when doctors couldn't already find them because we saw what kind of animals we became when we ran out of toilet paper.",The Ring of Fire,UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw,71427.0,651.0,6588.0,291.0,[],"['the ring of fire', 'progressive news', 'trofire', 'politics', 'the young turks', 'tyt', 'politics today', 'us news', 'breaking news', 'rof', 'current videos', 'farron cousins', 'dr. anthony fauci', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'fauci trump', 'fauci news', 'anthony fauci', 'dr. fauci', 'trump fires fauci', 'fauci white house', 'fauci covid', 'trump news', 'donald trump', 'trump today', 'trump live', 'trump speech']",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Qr2f3a4UVaA/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-mask,pseudoscience,,0

The background to this video is that there was a Christmas party that night in our local pub for the local women's soccer team. Katie's dad is the coach and two of her aunties play on the team. Katie comes to all the matches and training sessions and is basically the team mascot!. When she heard they were having a Christmas party she just couldn't understand why she wasn't invited😂😂. She had been begging her dad all day to bring her and after a few hours he gave up explaining that it was on too late, (kids are welcome in pubs with parents until 9/9.30pm), hence why she came to try and plead her case with me 😂😂. Katie is smart, funny, kind, courageous, caring, wise beyond her years, mannerful and full of life and I'm so proud that she has brought some laughter to so many people ❤️

How I Built The Life & Body of My Dreams - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7u1ZiiJhs

My name is Gregory O'Gallagher, I'm 24 years old! This is my story!!! If you enjoy the video, do me a big favour and give it a big, fat like.

A lot went into making this video, so I really hope you freaking dig it! We also shot it in super high definition, 4k resolution. So you can set the video to 4k mode for killer definition.

My idea was to do a film adaptation of two of my favourite movies, American Psycho and Dark Knight.. So basically Kinobody meets American Psycho, meets Bruce Wayne. This is what we came up with :) 

Anyways, if you're ready to join Kinobody! The first step is using the kinobody physique builder tool.

It took me a few years to put this thing together. The concept is there are 5 different physique categories you can fall into. Depending on which category you are in, you need an entirely different plan of attack..

Take the survey and join kinobody: http://kinojourney.com

mP33EaAEEL0,2020-05-01,Surgeon's Tips: Stop Fogging & Improve Seal on Medical Face Masks #ORTips,"Surgeon's Tips: Stop Fogging & Improve Seal on Surgical/Medical Face Masks

How to video for Medical Students, Nursing Students, and people in general who want to wear medical face masks more like the Healthcare Professionals to minimize fogging, and improve the seal around the mask.  

Why is this important? The surgeon, assisting residents, medical students, nurses, scrub techs cannot touch their face mask face or head covering once they “scrubbed in” for surgery.  

When operating or assisting in an operation, you will be “scrubbed in” AKA wearing **sterile** PPE (personal protective equipment: surgical gown, gloves. 

Your head covering, eye protection and face mask is not considered sterile, so you cannot reach up to your face or head. This will break the “sterile field” and you will need to remove the glove that touched your mask.  This is considered bad form and the surgeon or scrub nurse will think you are not experienced.  

Ideally you can maximize the fit and comfort of the surgical face mask before entering surgery, to avoid fogging of your eye protection later on during the surgery.  Vision is critical. If the surgeon says to retest here or clamp there, but you can’t see through the fog or condensation you may make a mistake.  

How does this translate to regular people wearing masks during the pandemic?  Once you leave your “safe place” (your home or car) and enter a store or public building or room, you should not be touching your head, face or mask, similar to surgery.  So making sure that you are wearing face mask like you are about to help with an operation should minimize any need to touch the mask, until you have returned home or back into your car.  

Weaknesses of this video.
1. I didn’t discuss how to carefully remove a medical face mask (already many videos explaining it.)
2. Medical face masks and CLOTH DIY face masks are DIFFERENT and this may not work for Cloth face masks because the cloth is not fluid resistant and the humidity go through the cloth and still fog the glasses. 
3. When wearing a surgical face mask in the operating room, the temperature does not change.  

Condensation of water on cold metal/glass/plastic
**Some fogging can occur when your glasses get cold from being outside, then when you enter a warmer room the cold glasses will fog up from any humidity in the air and any humidity from the mask. This is similar to why a cold drink gets wet on the outside of the can or glass.  

Simple Hack
***This video does not address how to keep your glasses warm.  A simple trick is to have a second pair of glasses kept at body temperature inside your coat or jacket. When you go indoors you can remove the cold glasses and wear the warm one. Put the cold glasses against your body to warm it up and it won’t fog up once it is warm.","George Yang, MD",UCVL-2VMrOIojHY8OaU1leaA,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVL-2VMrOIojHY8OaU1leaA,591578.0,279.0,7269.0,436.0,[],,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mP33EaAEEL0/sddefault.jpg,,,,,anti-mask,pseudoscience,,11

**The only feature we can truly copy from the N95 and Surgical Facemasks is the 1 time use and discard feature.**

A JAMA study (Sept 2019 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214) comparing the N95 respirators vs Surgical Masks in preventing influenza virus from a cluster randomized control trial of healthcare professionals using these masks in an outpatient setting (medical clinic/doctor's office which should be similar to our exposure in the public, like stores, offices, etc.) showed no significant difference between N95 (7.2% infections) and surgical masks (8.2% infections).  

With a 95% filtration of 0.3 micron particles, in theory this should prevent the flu virus from infecting the trained healthcare professionals when wearing these masks, yet there was 7.2% of flu infections amongst the HCP.  How is this possible?  Most likely the infection is occuring when handling the disposable masks (both surgical and N95) and some droplets with flu virus was on their hands when rubbing their nose, mouth and eyes which may have occurred before washing their hands.  

That may explain the 7.2% and the extra 1% which is not significant may be accounted for by the rare case of direct inhalation of flu aerosol droplets.

For non-trained people using face masks along with hand washing, I worry that they spent so much time on making a ""super-filtering"" face mask that they will keep the face mask for multiple uses and actually increase their risk from the larger droplets (more than 8% assuming immediately discarding the mask) while gaining a very minimal advantage on the aerosol inhalation risk.   Even the cloth masks can be the washed, but the filter material is hard to wash. I hope that makes sense.

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214

The main goal of “non-medical face covering” is to 1. keep the nose and mouth covered to prevent the an unwittingly infected user from openly spraying sneeze or cough droplets into the air which may land on surfaces or a person’s hand and 2. prevent a non-infected user from accidentally touching their nose or mouth with their own hand after receiving Coronavirus droplets from a hand shake, door knob, ATM or elevator button, etc. 

Non-medical face coverings or even surgical face masks will not protect the user from Coronavirus aerosol (floating microdroplets) from being inhaled.  Medical experts are reporting that the aerosol route of contracting Coronavirus is much lower than the droplet transmission from a contagious Coronavirus carrier with or without symptoms or inanimate objects (fomites) which that person has touched with a contaminated hand (sneeze or cough into their hand.)

The Lancet Journal April 2, 2020: Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions. Chin A, Chu JT, Mahen RAP, Hui KPY, Yen HL, Chan MCW, et alolan.  They studied how long the Covid-19 Coronavirus survived on different surfaces and environmental conditions.  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext

A microdroplet (5 ul) of Coronavirus was placed on various surfaces then tested for recovery of the virus after various amounts of time.

Tissue and printer paper: No detectable virus after 3 hours.
Wood and cloth: No detectable virus after 2 days
Glass and banknotes: No detectable virus after 4 days
Stainless steel and plastic: No detectable virus after 7 days.
Surprisingly, on the outer layer of a surgical mask a detectable level of virus could still be present (~0.1% of original virus in the micro droplet.)

GfOmBLtnTFU,2020-08-04,Vic Health Minister facing calls to resign after 'sickening parliament performance',"Adoni Media Managing Director Leisa Goddard says Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos stumbled her way through a “sickening performance” when questioned in parliament by opposition health spokeswoman Georgie Crozier.

According to the Herald Sun, Ms Mikakos ""has been labelled a ‘shameful disgrace’ and is facing calls to resign after fronting up to parliament against the advice of Victoria’s Chief Health Officer”.

The Health Minister avoided seven questions at Tuesday’s legislative Council question time by saying she would provide a written answer the following day.

“We’ve all heard politicians over the years say they’ll take a question on notice, but in this particular case, how dare she,” Ms Goddard said.

Ms Mikakos would have been aware of the type of questions she would be required to answer in the Victorian Parliament and should have been prepared to answer for her government’s mismanagement of the bungled quarantine program, Ms Goddard told Sky News host Peter Gleeson.

bfS9vgP8o_M,2020-07-29,'Authoritarianism meets ignorance' over mandatory Melbourne face mask policy,"Sky News host Rowan Dean says “authoritarianism meets ignorance” amid the strict implementation of face mask requirements in Victoria.

In Victoria, all people leaving their homes for essential purposes in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire are required to wear a mask or risk a $200 fine or $10,000 fine for businesses.

Sky News host Andrew Bolt said the Victorian government decided to mandate the use of face masks in accordance with a Lancet journal article which concluded face masks could reduce the spread of COVID-19.

“But yet how does that negate study after study, expert after expert for months telling us that in fact most of these face masks do not work, people touch them, they don’t use them correctly, they take them off the wrong way, they get infected,"" he said.

Mr Dean said there is a “really nasty streak of Trump derangement syndrome running through this entire pandemic” where anything that Trump supports, the media immediately denounces.

The government should “give people all the latest up to date information, even if some of it is contradictory from different studies and allow people to make up their own mind”.

“Otherwise we end up with this madness where … people are looking to their governments and not really understanding what their governments are telling them”.

In US news and current events today, the Black Lives Matter protests and George Floyd protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd have opened up a new dialogue about systemic racism in America, though these problems have existed for centuries. In conversation with Cornel West, Eddie Glaude Jr. discusses the landmark 1994 essay by James Baldwin, The White Problem, as it affects America today. Speaking to Eddie Glaude, Cornel West evokes one of the greatest Black writers of all time in discussing the sinister lie that lies at the heart of racism and injustice in America, and as the BLM protests and Black Lives Matter movement continues to spread across the globe, Americans must come face to face with their own unjust actions and beliefs.

In US news and current events today, in light of the Black Lives Matter protests and George Floyd protests that have risen around the world after the police killing of George Floyd, many politicians have been vocal about their demands for police reform, some even going so far as the call to defund the police. In light of systemic police racism, police violence and police brutality, advocates like NYC public advocate Jumaane Williams is adamant that decisive action must be taken. Jumane Williams, in this Jumaane Williams interview, states that he will block tax collection in New York City unless mayor Bill DeBlasio and the NYPD enact a hiring freeze, one of many measures that can make a dent in the defund NYPD and their massive, multi-billion dollar budget. Jumaane Williams speech and actions during the massive NYC protests have put him on the forefront of the movement within New York City, and unless drastic action is taken, the protests will not stop and the taxes will not be collected.

Are we not protecting ourselves well enough? We’re going to tackle this question head on and I've asked Dr. Rishi Desai, the former epidemic intelligence officer for the CDC, pediatric infectious disease doctor and current medical director at Osmosis, to give us his opinion.

What the difference between a surgical mask and N95?
Is coronavirus spread by droplet or aerosols? 

For those of you who are new here, I'm Siobhan, a 3rd year internal medicine resident working on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic in Canada.

Subscribe To InformOverload: http://bit.ly/2xB5CqA

A woman in California is claiming she’s owed half the money a Starbucks Barista has received through GoFundMe because they’re using her name to profit. If you’ve yet to hear about the incident, a woman named Amber Lynn Gillies, who is now being referred to as Karen, allegedly claimed she didn’t need to wear a mask in a Starbucks, which is legally required in the state of California. After Barista Lenin Guiterrez asked Amber if she had a mask, she allegedly flipped him off, started swearing at people, while calling everyone sheep and said she doesn’t need a mask. Amber then left the store, returned shortly after, took a picture of Lenin and claimed she’d be calling corporate. Amber’s story would go viral, after a facebook post, but now she’s likely regretting her decision, as it seems she’s been getting a lot of hate, while Lenin has been getting a lot of praise. I’m gonna tell you guys all about it right now on InformOverload.
