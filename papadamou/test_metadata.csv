DTv5BALgYuo,2015-08-29,"Process - The Technology Behind ""We Are Blood"" Part 1","Most people film skate videos with a single camera and a fisheye. If they're lucky, they might have a second camera and a set of lights. Ty Evans has always gone the extra mile in production value, though. If you've seen We Are Blood, you already know it had the budget and gear of a small Hollywood film. But having more money and equipment doesn't always make the job easier. Ty breaks down the process of achieving some of the craziest angles and shots ever filmed for a skate video. Gear nerd or not, you'll be stoked on this.

kIID5FDi2JQ,2016-12-02,Why all world maps are wrong,"Making accurate world maps is mathematically impossible.
Follow Johnny on Instagram www.instagram.com/johnny.harris/

Help us make more ambitious videos by joining the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Maps are flat representations of our spherical planet. Johnny Harris cut open a plastic globe to understand just what it takes to turn a sphere into something flat.

His struggle to make a flat map out of the plastic globe is indicative of a challenge mapmakers have faced for centuries: It is mathematically impossible to translate the surface of a sphere onto a plane without some form of distortion.

To solve this problem, mathematicians and cartographers have developed a huge library of representations of the globe, each distorting a certain attribute and preserving others.

For instance, the Mercator projection preserves the shape of countries while distorting the size, especially near the north and south pole.

For a more accurate view of land area look at the Gall-Peters projection, which preserves area while distorting shape.

In the end, there's not ""right"" map projection. Each comes with trade-offs, and cartographers make projection decisions based on the particular tasks at hand. But if you are interested in seeing an accurate depiction of the planet, it's best to stick with a globe.

If you saw the 2015 film ‘The Martian,’ you might recall main character Mark Watney (played by Matt Damon) mentioning something called an oxygenator…well, NASA’s newest device isn’t so far off from the sci-fi tech. 

The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment, better known as MOXIE, uses a technology called solid oxide electrolysis, and the goal? To produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere for both propellant and breathing. 

NASA is continuing to prepare for human exploration of Mars and is set to launch its next rover to the red planet in 2020. Seven instruments will be aboard the rover, six of which are focused on sample analysis like this SuperCam and a spectrometer called PIXL that’ll measure chemical signatures of Martian rocks. And MOXIE is the seventh. 

We sat down with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Instrument Systems Engineer Asad Aboobaker to find out more about how exactly MOXIE will make oxygen on Mars, check out this Focal Point to find out more.

XAtriMQPu5E,2020-07-17,Task force report says 18 states should roll back reopening,"An unpublished document prepared for the White House coronavirus task force and obtained by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit newsroom, recommends that 18 states in the coronavirus ""red zone"" for cases should roll back reopening measures amid surging cases.
The ""red zone"" is defined in the 359-page report as ""those core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) and counties that during the last week reported both new cases above 100 per 100,000 population, and a diagnostic test positivity result above 10%.""
The report outlines measures counties in the red zone should take. It encourages residents to ""wear a mask at all times outside the home and maintain physical distance."" And it recommends that public officials ""close bars and gyms"" and ""limit social gatherings to 10 people or fewer,"" which would mean rolling back reopening provisions in these places.
The report comes despite President Donald Trump's insistence that states reopen and a push to send the nation's children back to school, even as cases increase.
""Now we're open, and we want to stay open and we will stay open. We're not closing. We'll put out the fires as they come out,"" Trump said at a White House event earlier this month.
The following 18 states are in the red zone for cases: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.

It turns out, the measles vaccine was doing more than we previously thought. Getting infected with measles doesn't only make you sick, and carry a risk of death, it can also wipe out pre-existing immunity to other illnesses, making you more susceptible to other infections.

Outbreaks occur because of a breakdown in herd immunity. That's the topic of this week's Healthcare Triage.

3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13,Why beef is the worst food for the climate,"Avoiding high-emission foods can have a bigger climate impact than any other consumption change.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. 

The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer. 

This video was based on this chart, created by the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data:

229Fi8fOtho,2020-04-13,Coronavirus: Why Germany has been so successful in dealing with COVID-19,"A look at why Germany has been so successful in dealing with the pandemic, and has been able to keep its coronavirus death rate so low, compared to other nations, with Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister.

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others.

But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors.

In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany’s decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.’s decision to only test symptomatic cases.

Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany’s less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors.

“I think so far we’ve been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,” he told CNBC Thursday.

--

Your hands, up close, are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? Alex Rosenthal and Pall Thordarson investigate.

In US news and current events today, teacher Amanda Coffman resigned on the spot during a school board meeting and delivered a powerful message to her former students. 

Coffman is a former teacher at Indian Woods Middle School in Kansas. She says she resigned because she felt ‘silenced’ when Shawnee Mission School District issued teachers new 3-year contracts. 

Coffman says the contracts don’t address the concerns or needs that the teachers have fought for in the past.

Listen to Amannda Coffman's fiery resignation speech to the Kansas school board here. Here is how she plans to continue the fight for better education in America.

puAGzj0W0Qs,2016-04-26,This Commonly Prescribed Drug Could Help Treat Autism,"Researchers at the University of Missouri are studying how a commonly prescribed beta blocker could be used to treat individuals with autism.

""There was a study done in the 1980s that suggested a social and language benefit with this blood pressure drug, propranolol,"" Dr. David Beversdorf said.

Propranolol has been used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiovascular diseases since the 1960s. Dr. David Beversdorf and his colleagues wanted to explore other possible uses for the drug.

In their study, individuals with autism who took the drug instead of a placebo showed higher scores in social skills, such as eye contact, nonverbal communication and staying on topic.

""We were initially looking at it because of its use for test anxiety. That's exactly the drug people take for public speaking anxiety, performance anxiety. ...  And then we started to look at it in autism because they have flexibility issues with social interaction,"" Beversdorf said.

Propranolol is currently FDA-approved to treat a lot of things. Autism is not one of them.

An Autism Treatment Network spokesperson said the organization welcomes the research but also warned it's still too early to start prescribing the drug to people with autism.

This fall, researchers plan to conduct clinical trials that combine propranolol with early-intervention therapies. Beversdorf says the trial could take up to four years.

bfS9vgP8o_M,2020-07-29,'Authoritarianism meets ignorance' over mandatory Melbourne face mask policy,"Sky News host Rowan Dean says “authoritarianism meets ignorance” amid the strict implementation of face mask requirements in Victoria.

In Victoria, all people leaving their homes for essential purposes in metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire are required to wear a mask or risk a $200 fine or $10,000 fine for businesses.

Sky News host Andrew Bolt said the Victorian government decided to mandate the use of face masks in accordance with a Lancet journal article which concluded face masks could reduce the spread of COVID-19.

“But yet how does that negate study after study, expert after expert for months telling us that in fact most of these face masks do not work, people touch them, they don’t use them correctly, they take them off the wrong way, they get infected,"" he said.

Mr Dean said there is a “really nasty streak of Trump derangement syndrome running through this entire pandemic” where anything that Trump supports, the media immediately denounces.

The government should “give people all the latest up to date information, even if some of it is contradictory from different studies and allow people to make up their own mind”.

“Otherwise we end up with this madness where … people are looking to their governments and not really understanding what their governments are telling them”.

Polymerase chain reaction is a technique used to massively multiply DNA, so that it can be analyzed using other techniques. It requires a thermal cycler, filled with the DNA sample to be multiplied, thermostable Taq polymerase, primers with which we select what gets multiplied, and free nucleotides of all 4 types - A, T, C and G. The first step is denaturation, then there’s annealing, and finally extension.

P27HRClMf2U,2020-04-22,What face masks actually do against coronavirus,"Face masks don't make you invincible.

Support Vox by joining the Video Lab at http://vox.com/join or making a one-time contribution: http://vox.com/contribute

The fight against coronavirus is global. But the guidelines on whether you should wear a face mask as part of that fight are often completely different from place to place. That means that, for a lot of people, whether you wear a face mask when you leave the house is basically up to you.

Here’s where almost every expert agrees: If you have Covid-19, and you leave the house, you should wear a mask. Masks help keep sick people from spreading their germs. Most of the uncertainty around mask use is related to a totally separate question: Whether masks can protect healthy people from getting Covid-19.

The truth is that no mask can actually guarantee that you won’t get sick; experts say one of the most dangerous assumptions about face masks is that they basically make you invincible. Masks have to be used correctly to offer any protection at all, and they’re most effective if used alongside other preventative measures like hand-washing and social distancing.

But experts also say that the question of whether healthy people should wear masks is a lot easier to answer when you consider one of Covid-19’s most dangerous characteristics: Because of the disease’s long incubation period, and the high occurrence of infected people who never feel symptoms at all, it’s almost impossible to be completely sure that you don’t already have it. And that means the safest course of action is ultimately for everyone to behave like a sick person; in other words, to wear a mask.

Infectious disease specialist and special pathogens expert Dr. Syra Madad says that even if a coronavirus vaccine is developed, she has concerns about obstacles that stand in the way of mass vaccination. In particular, she says, convincing people to take the vaccine may be a challenge, citing the anti-vaccination movement. ""The anti-vax movement is vast,"" she says, calling it ""one of the biggest global health problems that we have.""

In this video we briefly review the two mask types used in clinical settings — the surgical mask and the N95 mask. We take a deeper look at the more effective N95 mask and the contract transmission risk associated with reuse. We also examine extra precautions set out by the CDC to reduce the risk of contact transmission. We review and discuss several articles on decontamination methods and preventing compromisation of the proper fit of the mask.

1jVNeSnVSks,2020-04-17,How to Obtain a Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen for COVID-19 suspected patients,"How to Obtain a Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen for COVID-19 suspected patients

Overview
--------------
Collection of specimens from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs is a procedure used for the diagnosis of Covid-19 in adults and children.1-4 The procedure is also commonly used to evaluate patients with suspected respiratory infection caused by other viruses and some bacteria. This video describes the collection of nasopharyngeal specimens for the detection of COVID-19, the illness caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

There are no specific contraindications for collecting specimens with nasopharyngeal swabs. However, clinicians should be cautious if the patient has had recent nasal trauma or surgery, has a markedly deviated nasal septum, or has a history of chronically blocked nasal passages or severe coagulopathy.

Preparation and Equipment
---------------------------------------------
Nasopharyngeal swabs are specifically manufactured to have long, flexible shafts made of plastic or metal and tips made of polyester, rayon, or flocked nylon. In addition to nasopharyngeal swabs, you will need personal protective equipment (PPE), including a gown, nonsterile gloves, a protective mask, and a face shield, as described below. Make sure that all sample tubes have been labeled and that the appropriate requisition forms have been filled out before starting the procedure.
It is essential that you follow the pertinent respiratory and contact precautions specified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and by your own institution and that you put on the PPE correctly. If possible, you should put on and take off the PPE in the presence of an observer to make sure there are no breaks in technique that may pose a risk of contamination.

First, put on a protective gown, wash your hands with soap and water (or use an alcohol-based solution), and put on a pair of nonsterile gloves. Then put on a protective mask with a rating of N95 or higher, as recommended by the CDC. Finally, put on a face shield for face and eye protection

Handling the Nasopharyngeal Swab Specimen.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open the collection tube and insert the swab into the tube. Break the swab at the groove and discard what remains of the swab. Close the labeled collection tube and place it in a biohazard bag (Figure 4). Depending on institutional practices, you may instead return the sample to its original packaging for transport. Follow the CDC directions for direct processing of the swab specimen or placement of the swab in media with or without refrigeration.

Removing Personal Protective Equipment
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove your PPE as shown in the video and described here or in accordance with the standards at your institution. First, remove your gown and gloves. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based solution or soap and water. Put on a new pair of gloves, and then remove your face shield and either dispose of it or clean and store it in accordance with the guidelines at your institution. Remove your gloves, rewash your hands, and put on another pair of gloves; then remove your mask and follow your institutional guidelines for disposal or reuse. Finally, remove the last pair of gloves and wash your hands.

Summary
----------------
This video demonstrates the collection of specimens from the surface of the respiratory mucosa with nasopharyngeal swabs for the diagnosis of Covid-19 in adults and in children. It is important to use approved PPE and the appropriate technique to minimize the possibility of spreading the virus

offPZ26SObs,2020-07-12,Coronavirus: Anti-mask activists rally in U.S. virus epicentre Florida,"Anti-mask activists on July 11 took their campaign to a grilled cheese bar and restaurant in Windermere, Fla., a state fast becoming the epicentre of COVID-19 in the United States. 

The grilled cheese bar, 33 & Melt, has become a focal point of tension after its owner said it was not demanding face masks in her establishment.

In response, the activists organised the gathering, with a promise of 100 free meals for patrons who come without any masks.

The rally became tense when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) agents arrived at the restaurant and served the owner with a warning.

President Donald Trump, who has avoided wearing a mask in public even as the coronavirus pandemic spread, donned one on Saturday at a military medical facility outside Washington where he was to meet with wounded soldiers and front-line health-care workers.

Top public health officials have urged the use of masks to slow the spread of the virus. Critics say Trump's refusal to wear one showed a lack of leadership.

Florida has emerged as an epicenter of COVID-19 infections in the country. Over the past two weeks, the state reported 109,000 new coronavirus cases, more than any other U.S. state.

The number of confirmed U.S. infections is over 3 million, according to a Reuters tally, stoking fears that hospitals will be overwhelmed. Nearly 134,000 Americans have died, a toll that experts warn will likely surge along with the rise in cases.

Overall, coronavirus cases are rising in 44 American states, based on a Reuters analysis of cases for the past two weeks compared with the prior two weeks.

Watch the BBC first on iPlayer 👉 https://bbc.in/iPlayer-Home Once again Nature's Weirdest Events has trawled the internet, raided their contact book and scoured the scientific world to unearth a treasure trove of bizarre and baffling stories. Using UGC clips of the events themselves, Chris Packham deconstructs the weirdness using eyewitness accounts, scientists and BBC archive footage.

In this series there is everything from scores of pigs swimming in the Caribbean to the tiny tick that is turning America vegetarian. There is a giant worm decimating fish tanks, a strange blob appearing when comets are seen, the real-life sea serpent washed up on the Californian coast and a Japanese island swarming with rabbits.

In the UK a virgin snake gives birth, in the US a sea serpent washes up and in Morocco 12 goats stand stock still in a tree. It's a weird world, and Chris Packham explains why.

Off the west coast of America sea stars are in trouble, tearing off their own limbs off which then wander away themselves.

FdZh1P57b1k,2020-01-19,Why SpaceX Blew Up A Falcon 9 Rocket On Purpose,"SpaceX and NASA on January 19 purposefully blew up a Falcon 9 rocket. The ""in-flight abort"" test was meant to assess the Crew Dragon escape system. The Crew Dragon is a spacecraft attached to the Falcon 9 that is designed to take human passengers to space. The planned explosion can be tied to the Apollo 1 accident in which three astronauts died during a preflight test. Some experts believe that the space race pressured NASA into cutting corners at the expense of safety while testing Apollo 1. This led to stricter regulations for space missions that still apply today.

Recently I went to a Tony Robbins event, Unleash The Power Within (UPW).  There was blood, sweat, tears, and of course Tony Robbins.  Aside from almost dying from aliveness, I came away enlightened about how to unleash my inner power onto the outer world.  The only thing more powerful than my Tony Robbins event experience is the fact that I documented it.  This video will help you unleash your power.

luTPMHC7zHY,2017-02-17,Why China is building islands in the South China Sea,"China claims they aren't military bases, but their actions say otherwise. 

Join the Vox Video Lab: http://bit.ly/video-lab

Since 2014, China has been building islands in the middle of the South China Sea. What were once underwater reefs are now sandy islands complete with airfields, roads, buildings, and missile systems. In less than two years, China has turned seven reefs into seven military bases in the South China Sea, one of the most contentious bodies of water in the world.

The sea is one of the most important areas of ocean in the world. It’s estimated to hold 11 billion barrels of oil, 109 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 10 percent of the world’s fisheries. Most importantly, 30 percent of the world’s shipping trade flows through the South China Sea to the busy ports of Southeast Asia. It’s an incredibly important strategic area, and five countries currently claim some part of it.

Most countries base their claims off the United Nations Law of the Seas, which says a country’s territory extends 200 miles off its shores, an area called the exclusive economic zone, or EEZ. Any trade or resources that fall in a country’s EEZ belong to that country; they’re its sovereign territory. Any area that is not in an EEZ is considered international waters and subject to UN maritime law, meaning it’s shared by everyone. Every country in the region, which includes Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Vietnam, bases its claim to the South China Sea on the UN’s EEZ laws — except China.

China argues it has a historical claim to the South China Sea, dating back to naval expeditions in the 15th century. After World War II, the Japanese Empire lost control of the South China Sea, and China took advantage of the moment to reclaim it. On maps, it started drawing a dashed line that encompassed most of the South China Sea. This line became its official claim and is known today as the Nine-Dash Line, because it always has nine dashes. In 1973, when the UN law established EEZs, China reaffirmed its Nine-Dash Line, refusing to clarify the line’s boundaries and rejecting other countries’ claims.

Since then, tensions have built around who rightfully owns the South China Sea. The dispute has centered on the Spratly Islands, an archipelago at the heart of the South China Sea. Currently, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim some part of the Spratly Island chain. They’ve asserted their claims by putting small buildings, ports, and even some people on what are essentially rocks in the middle of the ocean.

But the Spratlys are very important, because whichever country can successfully claim them can extend its EEZ to include them, thus gaining miles of precious sovereign territory. This is why China began building up islands in 2014. By turning these rocks into military bases, the Chinese are now able to support hundreds of ships, bolstering their presence in the region. They are using fishing boats, surveillance ships, and navy destroyers to set up blockades around other countries’ islands and defend their own. This is all done very cautiously and in small steps in order to avoid sparking a wider conflict.

Since China began building islands, the disputes have not become violent. But tensions are building in the region. As China deploys more of its military to the Spratlys, other countries are getting nervous and building up their own islands. It’s a complex situation that will continue to gain international attention, for better or for worse.

pAoEHR4aW8I,2019-04-10,Why this black hole photo is such a big deal,"What it took to collect these 54-million-year-old photons from a supermassive black hole.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

This is an updated version of a video we published in 2016 about the Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration to image a black hole for the first time in human history. 

On April 10, 2019, the team announced their results: They had successfully imaged the supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy m87, which is nearly 54 million light-years away from us. They were able to achieve unprecedented resolution using very long baseline interferometry, which combines the observations of multiple radio telescopes across the globe. 

The team wanted to find out whether Einstein's Theory of General Relativity holds up in the extreme environment of black holes, and the results do, in fact, seem to be consistent with the predictions. In the future, we may see more and shaper images of black holes as the team targets smaller wavelengths of light and recruits more telescopes. Eventually, they may include an orbiting space telescope. 

Vox Observatory takes a magnifying glass to some of life's most interesting questions with a focus on science and technology.

This is SARS CoV-2. It belongs to the family of coronaviruses, some of which cause disease in people and animals, named for crownlike spikes on their surfaces. SARS CoV-2 can cause COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, a contagious viral infection that attacks primarily your throat and lungs.

What actually happens in your body when you contract the coronavirus?  What exactly causes your body to develop pneumonia? And how would a vaccine work?

Note: A previous version of this video referred imprecisely to ""Neolithic Britain"" when discussing the Newgrange tomb in Ireland. We have removed that phrasing. My apologies to the Irish.

Stonehenge is a popular destination for summer solstice celebrations because the 5,000-year-old monument points toward the summer solstice sunrise on the horizon. However, it also points to the winter solstice sunset in the opposite direction and there's good reason to believe that this may have been the more important alignment for the Neolithic people who built Stonehenge. 

We investigate by constructing a tiny model of the Stonehenge monument.
